Never had a habit of peeing in the shower, but I thought everybody had that response.\nThe weird thing is that I get the same reaction every time I turn on the gas chromatograph at work, or walk into a room while its running. There is a small vial or water that drips but its not prominent and the only sound is from the fans, but every time I have to work with it, I have to pee within a minute or two.",

            "post_description": "I\u2019ve seen this seemingly humorous story elsewhere, and it\u2019s interesting how our clickbait infoverse has come to mean that a major part of the story is getting overlooked.\nThat is, there\u2019s a second and more important reason that some WOMEN should avoid peeing in the shower.\nFrom Newsweek,\nPeople with vaginas can\u2019t fully relax the pelvic muscles while standing up, even in the \u201cCaptain Morgan\u201d position with the leg up. This means that people then have to push past this barrier to urinate while standing up, which could cause problems in the long run.\n\u201cFrom a pelvic floor perspective, the position for peeing in the shower is not conducive to pelvic floor relaxation. AMAB (assigned male at birth) bodies have the prostate to support the bladder, which makes standing to urinate okay, but AFAB (assigned female at birth) bodies\u2014as well as people who have had affirmation surgeries\u2014do not have the same level of support for the bladder,\u201d she told Buzzfeed.\n\u201cTo maintain continence (i.e. not peeing your pants at inappropriate times), the pelvic floor generally wants to remain contracted in a standing or hovering position, so to urinate in those positions, one has to bypass these normal continence mechanisms, which can be problematic down the line.\u201d\nI guess that as Mark\u2019s choice of image suggests, it\u2019s still a man\u2019s world after all.",

The sound of running water doesn\u2019t cue my need to pee at all, but when diving once in a thermocline (rising up from cold to a warm layer of water) it created an involuntary peeing situation for which I was glad to be wearing a wetsuit, not my drysuit.\nI\u2019m also the evil person who will bait others by listing firehoses, waterfalls, \u2018gotta get a fountain!\u2019, splash mountain, lemon party, etc. to make them start doing the dance.
