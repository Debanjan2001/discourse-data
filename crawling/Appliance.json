Having pi-hole too would be great, I agree. The other parts, web admin tools and network config utilities would really cool too.I think the tricky part is, for a router, you typically want multiple hardware interfaces - usually multiple wired Ethernet ports. Are there good, abundant, reasonable-cost devices we can target with this kind of thing? A raspberry pi with a WiFi dongle could work for small installations, and perhaps that should be the first target?"

I am far to be an expert in virtual machine and I did found some posts related to this (https://askubuntu.com/questions/1263043/cannot-access-an-ubuntu-guest-vm-running-under-multipass-on-an-ubuntu-host-from), but with no practical solution, at least for me.I am therefore wondering if I am missing something.

This should only affect people who haven\u2019t configured security on the broker.I\u2019m keen to push the upgrade in the least disruptive way. At the moment I\u2019ve got the new version solely in the edge channel. I\u2019ve already got a 1.6 track which will stay on 1.6.x (the previous version) so even for new installs people will be able to get that version if they need it for some reason.Along with being able to roll back to a previous version easily, that makes the pain of a broken install at least reduced, but I wondered if you had any thoughts about the best way to handle this.Thanks,Roger"

I think there are a number of improvements necessary here:1: The documentation for installing it as a VM uses a simple multipass command.  The problem with this is the resulting VM spins up on an isolated NAT which only the host can access, which is obviously not helpful for a DNS server.  I get that your guide keeps it simple, and Multipass is excellent for this, but the end of the tutorial will leave some frustrated that it\u2019s not working after following the instructions to the letter.2: The guide should be much clearer that Adguard offers a paid service.  As I ventured to their homepage searching for documentation I was immediately concerned that I would be asked for money after having already installed the software.  This is a tone deaf oversight and not in keeping with the values I hold dear from Ubuntu."

Post your topic here with the tag #pna.I am a teacher struggling to connect with my students.  I\u2019ve been teaching for 20 years.  Distance learning is very tricky.  I need to see what my students are working on.  If a student is making a mistake, I\u2019d like to be able to correct it in real time.  For example, a student working on math problems might have the wrong algorithm.  If I can intercede quickly, I can correct the student\u2019s algorithm while they work.  Being able to have a document camera client would allow me to build raspberry pi  document cameras for my students cheaply and quickly.Is this an appliance for a project you lead or contribute to? Are you expressing interest in having this appliance, or in contributing to it?\nI\u2019d like to build cheap document cameras for all my students.  This client would go in to the raspberry pie running things.Is this an appliance for home users? Makers? Software engineers? Who would you like to reach with this appliance?\nThis client will be put in student document cameras allowing for a quick wifi connection and ease of use.Does the software for this appliance already run on Linux? On Ubuntu? Is there a snap yet? Is the software open source? Does your proposed new appliance require the use of any other snaps or software that you are not the maintainer of? e.g mir-kiosk or Microk8s.What hardware should your proposed new appliance work on? Are there any accessory requirements (cameras, actuators, relays, GPIO?) Does your proposed new appliance need anything extra or specific to work? e.g an external monitor, a dev kit, extra parts, etc.It would be nice to have the raspberry pi and be headless and plug and play.Does your appliance require Secure Boot or full disk encryption?Does your proposed appliance have existing documentation around privacy policy?Would this appliance use existing maintained debs from Ubuntu? Would it use other software which needs maintenance? Is there an upstream or vendor commitment to maintenance of that software?"

This would be similar to the AdGuard product but would protect against Malware and the like instead of/as well as Ads.This is something that I know how to build in that I work for ThreatSTOP which offers this product on regular Ubuntu servers. We have a Raspbian image and a Ubuntu ISO / VM that do this, and have developed docker images though they haven\u2019t been released, so it\u2019s just a question of understanding how to build an Ubuntu Appliance instead of a .ova or Raspbian imageDNS Firewalls in this sort of appliance form are particularly useful for SOHO and SMB work environments where they can offer the same protection that large organizations offer inside their large corporate networks using the same technology. With the current work from home trend it is becoming more and more important to extend the capabilities to homes and small offices. However there are plenty of benefits for home users too, as a DNS FW can protect unwary internet users, such as children, from downloading software they shouldn\u2019t or connecting to phishing sites and so on.As noted above we know how to build this in other environments. It is effectively a collection of standard ubuntu packages plus a small amount of configuration. The most complicated part is probably giving the appliance a fixed IP address at boot. We have this covered for Raspbian based off of work I have published at my gitbub page (see profile) and I assume there are similar methods available for Ubuntu AppliancesThere are no special hardware requirements (beyond a network connection). Lower spec Raspberry Pis cannot run bind with very large RPZ policies and larger networks will benefit from a Pi4 or NUC for performance but a SOHO network version (say 10-25 laptops/smarthphones etc.) works fine on a Pi2 or Pi3 as that is what I use personally.There are no particular security requirementsSince a DNS Firewall downloads a policy from the supplier and applies to locally to name resolution it is inherently a privacy improver. If (and this would be desired but optional) a user has a ThreatSTOP account and wishes to see reports on blocked traffic then the logs of the blocked traffic would be uploaded to ThreatSTOP for analysis. Such logs would be subject to the ThreatSTOP privacy policy termsThe software uses completely standard ubuntu packages. The changes involve editing the configuration of those packages. Currently those changes are implemented using either shell scripts or scripts in other standard linux languages such as perl."

I would like to contribute to turning it into an Ubuntu Appliance.Krellian Kiosk is primarily aimed at businesses in sectors like retail, hospitality, tourism and shared offices where they have a need for interactive kiosks or digital signage (e.g. digital billboards, self-service kiosks, departure boards, information boards, interactive exhibits, wayfinding kiosks and digital menus). However, as a general purpose kiosk web runtime for displaying passive or interactive web content it has a range of applications for business and home use where a single web application needs to be displayed full screen (e.g. for smart home control or rendering slide decks at conferences).Krellian Kiosk is an Electron and Node.js-based application which already runs on Linux and has a work-in-progress snap package for Ubuntu Core using mir-kiosk. Krellian Kiosk is licensed under GPLv3.The appliance is initially targeting the Raspberry Pi 3, but I would like it to run on a range of industrial PCs and touch-based hardware in the future. The appliance requires an HD TV or monitor and an Ethernet or Wi-Fi network connection and can optionally support input devices like a touchscreen or mouse and keyboard.The appliance could benefit from secure boot or full disk encryption but does not require them.Krellian Kiosk acts as a local web server so that it can be remotely controlled via the Web of Things and a self-hosted web interface. Access will be authenticated via a password/JSON Web Token, but local access will only be able to use plain HTTP due to inherent limitations TLS on local networks. Krellian Kiosk can therefore optionally be used in conjunction with Krellian Console which will be a hosted service providing secure remote access via a TLS dynamic tunneled reverse proxy.Krellian Kiosk does not currently collect any private user data. In future it may use anonymous pings for usage analytics and optionally collect some private user data for the purposes of signing up to the Krellian Console service. Krellian\u2019s general Privacy Policy can be found here.Apart from the maintenance of the Krellian Kiosk snap itself, the appliance would depend on upstream software including Electron (maintained by GitHub) and mir-kiosk (maintained by Canonical).I\u2019d be grateful for any help from Canonical or the Ubuntu community in getting this appliance up and running."
