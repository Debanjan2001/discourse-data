There is no clickable text called News & Views that I see. But even if there was, that isn\u2019t going to funnel many people here (how you and @bluevote found it still escapes me). So it seems like people can only find this thread with an invite? Being limited to 5, I will add on this post:\n@Maineac, @minecritter, @1Nall, and though I have no idea of he is coming back, it is after Jan 1 now, so I hope @SkepticTank is willing to post though I would understand if he is bitter.\nOf the 2 possibilities you mention, I am more interested in M4A (should I stay with M4A or is MfA or MFA better? writing it out all the time seems tedious). But I don\u2019t have any problem with anyone who wants to discuss anything on this thread.\nOn M4A, I am as you know still interested in #forcethevote. I listen to Jimmy Dore a lot and he is definitely not for everyone, but as they say, one should be able to judge an idea on its merits and not on whether one likes the person who came up with it. (My exception on this is if the idea is very complicated and I\u2019m not going to be able to understand it in which case I will use a little \u201cappeal to authority\u201d if I like that authority and trust them - that doesn\u2019t apply here). I haven\u2019t heard anyone use the argument that Jimmy is bad, thus the idea is bad, but it is supposedly out there.\nI have signed on at ~https://forcethevote.org/ and only about 40k people have signed thus far. I wish it was a lot more and I wish more people from PNHP would sign on (in this post, there is a reference to Dr. Flowers advocating for it: ~https://commons.commondreams.org/t/in-secret-ballot-vote-house-democrats-overwhelmingly-deny-aoc-a-powerful-committee-seat/85222/109). I\u2019ve heard Dr. Adam Gaffney some more now and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s as opposed to the idea as I first gathered. It\u2019s kind of hard to keep up with Katie Halper\u2019s content - conversations go on for many hours and I haven\u2019t heard all of what Gaffney has said on these YouTube shows and I haven\u2019t found a written piece by him on the topic. But I find AOC\u2019s comment that the leaders of the movement haven\u2019t asked for this annoying. Because 1) One leader clearly has, 2) a non-trivial number of people in the movement clearly feel differently and at least she can engage us (she could have showed up at the recent townhall which I wasn\u2019t able to see yet, but I know she wasn\u2019t there).\nAs far as the idea goes - as you know these are some of the previous points I\u2019ve made which I repeat for this thread:\nIf there is another M4A related thing we want besides a floor vote, we should be demanding that too. I happen to think the floor vote is a significant thing and I\u2019m not enthusiastic about state run single payer systems (though I would of course support trying if it happens in California which hasn\u2019t been in the cards for us this far - I don\u2019t think our current governor would do it either, but maybe his hand can be forced).\nThis \u2018demand\u2019 should really be phrased to Pelosi as \u201cwhy do you care if you give us this?\u201d There is no one (besides Dore) that I know of that thinks House, Senate, and Biden would go along with the plan we have now at this time (or in Biden\u2019s case - ever). Pelosi can make her case of why she thinks it is a stupid idea and she can get her \u201copposing the left\u201d cred which I assume she wants (it\u2019s working for her thus far).\nA floor vote (and whatever discussion that goes along - if there were none and just a 5 min. vote, I don\u2019t think I would care about this idea - but as I understand it, there will be discussion along with hopefully laying out basic funding scheme options which those that read Michael Pollin might now, but many don\u2019t) will give us the following things:\na) It lays out clearly who is with us and who is against us (I hated GWB, but I do feel polarization on this issue is not a bad thing).\nb) It will get the idea into more people\u2019s heads (well, we don\u2019t control the media and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll do their best to spin it against us, but I still think more exposure is helpful).\nc) On this point - I am not the most confident, but I think it will allow us to dig into financing details more and help frame future bills.\nIn general, I find the argument that it won\u2019t pass besides the point. The idea is to be as ready as we can whenever it can pass (I assume 4 years is the soonest possible time frame, but I absolutely don\u2019t want to wait 25 years - assuming I live that long).\nThanks for thinking of me!\nAnybody who posts - please add 5 more usernames you think might be interested.",

Does this messaging sound the slightest bit contemptuous, possibly racist-slash-Islamophobic, to anyone else?\nIt should be perfectly clear to all by now: Afghans don\u2019t resist Taliban because they regard Taliban as Afghan. Couldn\u2019t be much simpler. Why twist it into this distorted picture of Afghan weakness, corruption, or incompetence? Doesn\u2019t such an attitude risk piling on with more recklessly scattershot contempt for a proud people?",

Biden fails to have empathy with the Afghan soldier. As Master Sun\u2019s Art of War points out, integrity of a nation at war depends on the leader convincing everybody of a powerful mission statement. Soldiers must believe in their mission, and belief and trust must be both solid and flexible up and down the line of command. If I believe that my squad leader works for my benefit and our common cause, that belief has to entail a belief that at all points in the line of command there are people who are behind me and behind every soldier.\nI think the reality, as the average Afghan soldier saw it, was that the real line of \u201chaving my back,\u201d went through Americans they had direct contact with. What was left for this soldier if the USA pulled out?\nMy belief is that a nation and/or an army cannot successfully be imposed from outside. It must develop organically, from within the people. How did George Washington manage to get a real army out of former colonials, most of whom probably only knew what they didn\u2019t want. What made an apprentice miller boy into a soldier and kept him in that role?",

Jeebus on a cracker! Who is running things at the State dept and Pentagon these days, the Marx brothers? \u201cSorry everybody, but after 20 years you have 5 minutes to pack your bags and get to the airport. Where are we taking you? We\u2019ll figure that out once we get in the air\u2026.\u201d\nWhile there was probably no good way to exit Afghanistan after all this time, we didn\u2019t need to turn it in to a crappy community theater version of the fall of Saigon.\nAnd now, matters are worse. Another wave of Covid is hitting the US. The economy is still sluggish. Gerrymandering has begun in earnest in key battleground states, and now old uncle Joe Biden and his equally feeble acolytes have decided that what the Democratic Party really needed at this time of crisis is another Bay of Pigs fiasco.\nOnward to 2022\u2026\u2026",

Use the last activity time and comment count to enter at the top or bottom.\nWhile reading a comments on an article, jump to the top \u2191 by selecting the article title. Select the green progress bar at the bottom right for full navigation controls, or use the\nhome\nand\nend\nkeys.\nHow do I reply?\nTo reply to the overall article, use the Reply button at the very bottom of the page.\nTo reply to a specific comment, use the Reply button on that comment.\nTo quote someone in your reply, select the text you wish to quote, then press any Reply button.\nTo ping someone in your reply, mention their name. Type @ and an autocompleter will pop up.\nFor standard Emoji 7, just start typing : or the traditional smileys :)\nWhat else can I do?\nThere are action buttons at the bottom of each comment.\nTo let someone know that you enjoyed their comment, use the like button. If you see a problem with a comment, please let our staff know about it by using the flag button or, if you wish, privately message the commenter with your concerns.\nYou can also share a link to a comment or bookmark it for later reference - it will be saved on your personal user page.\n##Can I see my commenting history?##\nYes, your comments, along with likes and replies, are stored on your personal profile page. Live notifications will let you know whenever someone has replied or interacted with your comment.\n##The comments aren\u2019t threaded. How can I tell if someone has replied to my comment? Or if a comment is a response to something else?##\nYou can see all the replies to comments by clicking \u201creplies\u201d, as you can see here:\nWho is talking to me?\nWhen someone replies to your comment, quotes your comment, or mentions your @username, a number will immediately appear at the top right of your page. Use it access your notifications.\nDon\u2019t worry about missing a reply \u2013 you\u2019ll be emailed direct replies (and private messages) if you aren\u2019t online when they arrive.\nWhen are conversations new?\nBy default all conversations less than two days old are considered new, and any conversation you\u2019ve participated in (replied to, created, or read for an extended period) will automatically be tracked.\nYou will see the blue new and number indicators next to these articles:\nYou can change the individual notification state of an article\u2019s discussion via the control at the bottom of the article discussion (this can also be set per category). To change how you track articles, or the definition of new, see your user preferences.\nWhy can\u2019t I do certain things?\nNew users are somewhat limited for safety reasons as we build our new community. For example, most spammers and fly-by trolls post links or images then move on. Thus, new users cannot post links or images at first.\nAs you participate here - by reading, liking, sharing, and commenting, you\u2019ll gain the trust of the community, and become a full citizen, and those limitations will automatically be removed. At a high enough trust level, you\u2019ll gain even more abilities to help us manage our community together.\nWe believe in civilized community behavior at all times.\nEnjoy your stay!",

We, too, are a shared community resource \u2014 a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation. These are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.\nImprove the Discussion\nHelp us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later. The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.\nBe Agreeable, Even When You Disagree\nYou may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That\u2019s fine. But, remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid: Name-calling. Ad hominem attacks. Responding to a post\u2019s tone instead of its actual content. Knee-jerk contradiction. Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.\nBe Nice to Our Writers, Even When They Piss You Off\nOur contributing writers put their ideas and opinions into the public sphere using their real identities - not anonymous screen names. You may agree or disagree strongly with their ideas and we are providing you a forum to debate them. But any posters making personal attacks on our contributing writers will not be welcome in our community.\nOne Person, One Voice\nAll are welcome in our community. We believe that communities where people take a stand by speaking out using their real names are the healthiest communities. We understand that some need to remain anonymous for professional or personal reasons and we will allow for that. However, anyone attempting to use multiple screen names or log-ins is not welcome here. One person, one voice.\nYour Participation Counts\nThe conversations we have here set the tone for everyone. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be \u2014 and avoiding those that do not. The Commons provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: favorites, bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else\u2019s, too. Let\u2019s try to leave our park better than we found it.\nIf You See a Problem, Flag It\nModerators have special authority; they are responsible for keeping this forum civil. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police. When you see bad behavior, don\u2019t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone\u2019s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention. In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts in any way; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.\nAlways Be Civil\nNothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness: Be civil. Don\u2019t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech. Keep it clean. Don\u2019t post anything obscene or sexually explicit. Respect each other. Don\u2019t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information. Respect our forum. Don\u2019t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum. These are not concrete terms with precise definitions \u2014 avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you\u2019re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times. This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.\nKeep It Tidy\nMake the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So: Don\u2019t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics. Don\u2019t post no-content replies. Don\u2019t divert a discussion by changing it midstream. Don\u2019t sign your posts \u2014 every post has your profile information attached to it. Rather than posting \u201c+1\u201d or \u201cAgreed\u201d, use the Like button.\nPost Only Your Own Stuff\nYou may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone\u2019s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.",
