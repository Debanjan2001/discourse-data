While the Seven Hills and Cleveland officers awaited backup, a man went into the Subaru and then left driving a black Mercedes.\nPolice attempted to pull him over; however, the Mercedes was traveling at a high rate of speed. The Subaru was impounded. Police are investigating.\nIt sounds to me like they choose not to engage in high-risk chases.",

For those who are younger, before speculating on the norms of the period: (a) an adult sleeping with a 12-year-old was not considered normal in 1965. (b) a parent letting their 12-year-old daughter hang out with rock stars in their hotel room was not considered responsible parenting in 1965.\nI don\u2019t know the facts of this case, and hope the courts work it out, but don\u2019t think notions of values of the time should be used to make the offense seem either more or less likely, or more or less despicable.",
