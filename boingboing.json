Here is my secret recipe for what I call \u201dmarinated monkey meat.\u201d\nOnly tested on beef and pork so far.\nNo monkeys were injured in developing this recipe .\nFor each pound of flesh:\n2 oz of soy sauce\n2 oz apple cider vinegar\n1 tsp of hot sauce ( Sriracha works great )\n2 crushed cloves of garlic\n7 drops of liquid smoke ( optional )\n1/8th tsp of fish sauce ( also optional )\nCut flesh into 1/2 inch thick strips ( skirt steak is really swell as it is )\nPlace in appropriate sized plastic bag or other container.\n1 hour in the fridge, turn over flesh and massage every 15 minutes.\nAlways massage your meat.\nPat dry and put back in the fridge on a plate for 1 hour to dry even more.\nRefrigerators are dehumidateers .\nDry equals a good sear.\nI use a Weber gas grill.\n2 minutes on each side for medium rare.\nI tent with aluminum foil after grilling for 15 minutes before cutting into bite-sized bites and serve over Kimchee rice.
