Fortunately it was more than just MS, so I didn\u2019t lose my entire shirt, but fuckityFUCKFUCK!\nI am unbelievably angry with myself, mostly at my self-deception. I had learned it before in another class a while back and I convinced myself I didn\u2019t need to practice it and focus on other things. I clearly don\u2019t remember it, and looking through a textbook, I realize I\u2019m actually inept at it. Now I have to go to office hours and relearn this skill that I thought I had. And it\u2019s a fundamental skill that I want to develop, not just for this class.\nWhat annoys me most is that I can\u2019t find good resources on it. I have the old standby: A textbook that basically every chemistry student has nationwide, and then\u2026 nothing that is really helping it \u201cclick\u201d in my mind so that I can approach problems with any confidence. I can rationalize a correct answer, but I lose all confidence working towards one. Shit like this makes me seriously wonder if I have the chops for what I\u2019m doing.",

So this is a two parter.\nDon\u2019t psych yourself out. This is critical. Acknowledging that something is hard is good, criticizing yourself for not being a master is bad. You must possess humble confidence\u2013which means you are going to fail, but failure leads to understanding.\nSecond, start solving your problems or exercises at quarter speed. Literally. Check every number, every calculation, use perfect penmanship, everything. If there is a mistake, start again even slower till it is impeccable. When it is impeccable, only then increase the speed at which you solve, calculate, and record.\nThere is a third step, but I don\u2019t want to muddy things",

More evidence that the lie of racial whiteness never stops reshaping itself, but also, if I\u2019m reading it right, evidence as well that Tromp\u2019s dumping on Puerto Rico (lumping it in with other places in his fans\u2019 imaginations as another \u201cshithole\u201d country, despite it being a weird part of the U.S.) was counterproductive. It of course drove many Puerto Ricans away from being Republican voters (which doesn\u2019t seem covered in the study), but it also helped to shrink the US\u2019s \u201cwhite\u201d population.
