For his opponents, however, a much higher burden is imposed and only Trump, at his sole discretion, will decide if his opponent\u2019s evidence (and it has to be more than accusations) is sufficient. Spoiler alert: it never will be.\nAlso, when Trump makes a bare accusation, the burden lies with the opponent to prove the accusation is not true. Trump doesn\u2019t have to provide any evidence. Also, the fact that many people believe Trump is substantial evidence that he\u2019s correct.",

Fortunately it was more than just MS, so I didn\u2019t lose my entire shirt, but fuckityFUCKFUCK!\nI am unbelievably angry with myself, mostly at my self-deception. I had learned it before in another class a while back and I convinced myself I didn\u2019t need to practice it and focus on other things. I clearly don\u2019t remember it, and looking through a textbook, I realize I\u2019m actually inept at it. Now I have to go to office hours and relearn this skill that I thought I had. And it\u2019s a fundamental skill that I want to develop, not just for this class.\nWhat annoys me most is that I can\u2019t find good resources on it. I have the old standby: A textbook that basically every chemistry student has nationwide, and then\u2026 nothing that is really helping it \u201cclick\u201d in my mind so that I can approach problems with any confidence. I can rationalize a correct answer, but I lose all confidence working towards one. Shit like this makes me seriously wonder if I have the chops for what I\u2019m doing.",

You must possess humble confidence\u2013which means you are going to fail, but failure leads to understanding.\nSecond, start solving your problems or exercises at quarter speed. Literally. Check every number, every calculation, use perfect penmanship, everything. If there is a mistake, start again even slower till it is impeccable. When it is impeccable, only then increase the speed at which you solve, calculate, and record.\nThere is a third step, but I don\u2019t want to muddy things",
