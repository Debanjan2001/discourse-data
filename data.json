Here (in Hu\u00e1nuco, Peru) it was served roasted/grilled or as pachamanca 3 and cut in half nose to tail. Tasty, but a lot of work to eat. The two guys from Lima who were with us definitely had an embarrassed attitude of \u201cthis is peasant/country/redneck food\u201d when I said I was going to order it.",

More evidence that the lie of racial whiteness never stops reshaping itself, but also, if I\u2019m reading it right, evidence as well that Tromp\u2019s dumping on Puerto Rico (lumping it in with other places in his fans\u2019 imaginations as another \u201cshithole\u201d country, despite it being a weird part of the U.S.) was counterproductive. It of course drove many Puerto Ricans away from being Republican voters (which doesn\u2019t seem covered in the study), but it also helped to shrink the US\u2019s \u201cwhite\u201d population. Oh the ironies.",

Here is my secret recipe for what I call \u201dmarinated monkey meat.\u201d\nOnly tested on beef and pork so far.\nNo monkeys were injured in developing this recipe .\nFor each pound of flesh:\n2 oz of soy sauce\n2 oz apple cider vinegar\n1 tsp of hot sauce ( Sriracha works great )\n2 crushed cloves of garlic\n7 drops of liquid smoke ( optional )\n1/8th tsp of fish sauce ( also optional )\nCut flesh into 1/2 inch thick strips ( skirt steak is really swell as it is )\nPlace in appropriate sized plastic bag or other container.\n1 hour in the fridge, turn over flesh and massage every 15 minutes.\nAlways massage your meat.\nPat dry and put back in the fridge on a plate for 1 hour to dry even more.\nRefrigerators are dehumidateers .\nDry equals a good sear.\nI use a Weber gas grill.\n2 minutes on each side for medium rare.\nI tent with aluminum foil after grilling for 15 minutes before cutting into bite-sized bites and serve over Kimchee rice.
