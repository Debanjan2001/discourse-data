There\u2019s enough dissers out there that go to things and also plenty of people that have to end up going alone when they\u2019d rather not - so why not set them up! Blind dates for indie gig snobs, if you will\n(Obviously solo gigging is perfectly fine, this is just an alternative for people to explore)\nPlease include the band, city, venue and date in your post so we can have some semblance of order",
