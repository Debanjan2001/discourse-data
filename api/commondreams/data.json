I did some kind of simple math that isn\u2019t really completely valid, but I think still gets at a result that I suspect is true that I discussed with dperal recently: most of the protection you get against dying from Covid by being vaccinated is avoiding the ICU in the first place - once you get there, your chance of not dying is still better if you are vaccinated, but nearly by the ratio that the avoiding the ICU is.  I wondered if this poster was getting those kinds of stats confused at first - but who knows - maybe just a troll.",

If a majority favors recalling Mr. Newsom, he is removed from office. But the latter question is decided by a plurality, and whichever candidate gets the most votes, even if it is much less than a majority, becomes the next governor. Critically, Mr. Newsom is not on the ballot for the second question.\nBy conducting the recall election in this way, Mr. Newsom can receive far more votes than any other candidate but still be removed from office. Many focus on how unfair this structure is to the governor, but consider instead how unfair it is to the voters who support him.\n\n\nMakes it clear, given the stupidity of the process, Newsom should (again obviously) have put his Lt. Governor forward for the second round.",

Give me policies; give me votes. I have watched Democrats talk left and vote right for a long time now.\nA lot of us used to feel that we could mostly trust that because in the wake of FD Roosevelt, the Democratic Party mostly stood for for social programs as opposed to anticommunist nonsense and oppression. And after the Kennedys and '68, the Democrats were no longer the party of race, as few recall that they had been. previously.\nBut now the Democrats are no longer a party of social programs and reduced oppression, though the Republicans are not either.\nWhy should I not believe that if the recall goes through and a corporatist hound goes down, that is no big loss? Why would I not imagine that I at least rid the Democratic Party of part of its problem, so that I might have a progressive Democrat to vote for at some future date?\nIf I have a Democratic incumbent, do I not need to hope for a Republican progressive?

The only way this gets done, and millions of people don\u2019t find themselves living under a highway overpass, is for Joe Biden to declare war on the Supreme Court. He must of course first ignore the latest SCOTUS ruling. Then call all nine of those monarchs in to the Oval Office, no chairs, and inform them that the full weight of the justice dept will be brought down upon each one of them. If they have so much as an unpaid parking ticket it will be cause for impeachment. And of course, all of your resignations will be accepted.\nDoes Joe Biden and his party have the chutzpah to declare war on the Supreme Court? Probably not.

It was in the Seattle Times, a story about an Afghan immigrant, now U.S. citizen, whose Afghan wife (not U.S. citizen, w/Green Card) went back to Afghanistan to visit her parents with their American citizen children. Her return flight was scheduled for the middle of Sept. (Have to say I don\u2019t how this was the case since Biden reportedly announced at the beginning of the year we were going to be out by the end of August \u2026 but anyway,) they wanted something like 10,000 dollars to change the flight. I gather they paid it (or used credit cards?), but then, because of the situation, she wasn\u2019t able to get to the airport in time (or something) \u2013 and they wanted something similar in amount again for another seat.  Or some such horror story. That there was radical inflation of the airline tickets. Don\u2019t know if that part has since changed \u2026  sounds like it has \u2026 and \u2026 unfortunately, haven\u2019t seen news of whether this mother and her U.S. children have even gotten out yet.\nBut yes, Erik Prince is a \u201cmonstrous human.\u201d Think of the gasoline, too, for these flights only carrying a few select and wealthy whatevers (probably war criminals if they\u2019re riding with Erik).",

Short version: looking bad and soon to get much worse. But before this article, it\u2019s hard to know what is \u201creally\u201d going on outside the airport. But Psaki did make a public statement that, if people know Americans (and probably Afghans too - I forget her wording) in Afghanistan (i.e. stuck somewhere) and have their contact information, they can contact her office and they will contact them and help them leave. It\u2019s on a video, though her words aren\u2019t being shared far and wide bc they\u2019re so anxious to make the Biden administration look as bad as possible for leaving people behind, that they\u2019re actually helping to make that happen.",

But this is probably the worst thing we can do right now. And as an organization that was early in recognizing the harm that forced removal of pain medicine from patients was a brutally unjustified state intervention in medicine, to advocate that same use of force in favor of vaccinations is no less problematic.\nWe have to find another way to bring these people in.",

San Francisco is having to start firing employees, in regular contact with the public, who cannot rationally articulate a reason for them, in particular, to refuse this shot, in particular. Most of the ninnies are super-macho police and what-not, but one of the people SF had to fire was the symphony\u2019s choral director, who turns out to be insane.\nAre you trying to say this is about freedom, unlike all other required vaccinations? Are you trying to build some link between your freedom to access pain meds and the right of he-man police and prison-guards to chicken out on vaccines? Because this isn\u2019t making any sense, frankly. These are serious times, calling for serious discussion from serious people. We can joke around, but this vaccine is quite serious business, for human survival.\nWhat do you mean by \u201cforce\u201d or \u201canother way\u201d \u2013 nobody\u2019s forcing anyone to take certain public jobs.

(There\u2019s a recent ProPublica story on this epic failure from CDC.)\nStudies find a 5% drop in vaccine effectiveness per month \u2013 but we\u2019re perpetually confused about different levels of effectiveness: against any infection, or against severe illness. It\u2019s always disconcertingly weird to find oneself using the phrase \u201capartheid aside\u201d \u2013 but Israel happens to have the best data. I always pay attention to it, because their tracking, coverage, enrollment (apartheid aside!) has been peerless.\nSARS2:Delta is a new virus, I think. You know, Caroline, that I\u2019m seeing stuff in NOAA\u2019s methane tracking that freaks me out more than most. Well, it\u2019s pretty much the same story with my diligent munching over USA\u2019s COVID stats. I\u2019ve been saying since before 8/1 this month could top last winter\u2019s worst, based on the strength of Delta\u2019s growth vector, in the metric of new-cases.\nGrowth in new-cases has been more than twice as strong as any time since outbreak inception. It takes three weeks for a parallel time-delayed spike in deaths to occur, if it\u2019s going to. Sure enough: That parallel surge in the growth-rate of deaths is mounting as we speak. We have further confirmation Delta is at least as deadly as previous variants.",

Something I\u2019ve been saving for a special occasion \u2013 times like these.\nIn this passage, which I thought you might like, Thay describes \u201cletting go\u201d:\n\nThe practice of releasing your knowledge is very important in Buddhism. Knowledge is the first obstacle of the mind that a meditator should be able to remove. We should not be too sure of anything.\nWith knowledge, we obtain more notions and it is difficult to let them go. If we are skillful, we can use new notions like co-arising and interbeing to free ourselves from old notions like birth and death, being and nonbeing. But once we are freed from these ideas we have to let go of even the notions of interbeing and co-arising. All the teachings are like that. Just as when we use a spade to dig a well, once the well is dug we have to put the spade away. We do not need to carry it around with us wherever we go.\n",

One thing I would add that does not seem to be factored in:  the cases that are asymptomatic, or that people mistake for a cold or a mild flu and just rest through it.  I know that is impossible to enumerate, but it is something to consider.  Another that has been raised, whether correctly or not cannot know, is the potential number of deaths that are ascribed to Covid, when it may be in some cases it was the underlying condition that terminated their life, or was co-equal to Covid.  Again, we can\u2019t know that.  Overall, I have found statistics to emphasize cases and deaths and leave the rest out.  This method may be giving us a partial picture.  I have looked a couple of times at the source  you use, and yes, it is difficult to read.  Normally when I find something difficult I tend to suspect some level of obfuscation\u2013whether intentional or accidental cannot know either.  I do think that date could be presented more clearly by sites such as these, and should not require a statistic degree to decipher.  Best wishes",

After reading the Forbes article (search for middle school students solve the issue of gerrymandering), I\u2019d say your explanation above is a bit misleading though.  That would imply districts with very smooth curves for boundaries and no regard to following streets or rivers or any other existing dividing lines. But if you look at their solution for  Alabama, there have to be other considerations used by the program (if you zoom in you can see boundaries are jagged).\nI\u2019d be curious to read your story on these kids - how do I find it?  Do you know if they put the program into the public domain somehow?  I\u2019d love to see it.  I\u2019d say this is pretty sophisticated for middle school - my kid\u2019s 12 and he\u2019s nowhere near ready for something like this (he\u2019s pretty good at math, but this is a sophisticated programming problem) - congrats to the parents too for raising kids motivated to try something like this.  All district drawing should be done by open source software for sure.\nEDIT: I searched for this story and your name and I see a comment from you at Consortium News but I haven\u2019t found your story yet.",

Alas, both isn\u2018t in the cards at the moment.\nIf nothing is done about the current GOP attempts to establish permament minority rule - and HR1 + the John Lewis Rights Act seem to be the only pieces of legislation the Dems decided to bestow upon us peasants - we won\u2018t even have the slightest resemblance of democracy in a few years from now. Biden will become a lame duck president and any sane progress - aside from a few reversable executive actions - will become impossible. Especially for the world climate that\u2018ll be a catstrophe.\nI know those acts are far from ideal but a bird in the hand would be worth two in the bush. It\u2019s nearly certain though that you don\u2018t have to worry anyway, they\u2019ll die in the Senate. I just hope this won\u2018t lead to indefinite one party rule in the end.\nAnd @Godless yes, Democrats have nobody to blame but themselves. Clinton invited the 3rd Way Blue Dogs into the party who watered down its agenda and have skewed it to the right, from Main to Wall Street, from Labor to Suburbia. Alas, Obama and Biden fully continued that trend.\nBut as I already said, everything is better than permanent minority rule by the Trump-Taylor-Greene-McConnell Republican party.

Put some person in Oshkosh in charge of one robot and give her a task such as watching for fireline-jumping embers and putting them out.\nWe need to get far more water up to various fire lines, using far less total fossil fuel to get it up there.\nI\u2019d like to see quickly deployable ember-stopping nets made of metal fibers or of fiberglass.  I\u2019d like to see fire-insulating covers delivered on trucks and dropped over entire houses, preferably delivered a day early.\nIn any case, the real forest story is keeping the trees watered in the first place so they don\u2019t burn.  The African Greenbelt project has suggestions for creating single-tree swales that store water, which is better than letting certain megafloods go straight down the river and cause havoc.  California should replace 100% of its non-native Eucalyptus trees, a real pyromaniac species, with better species, and that takes some work.",

Sea salt is a salable by-product.\nThe best time to distill water is late at night when everything is cool and when natural fog can form to inexpensively water crops and the wild lands too.\nTo save nearly boiling water in a solar pond until nearly dawn, I recommend creating a surface of  floating glass \u201cdiamonds\u201d.  The floating glass surface permanently seals the solar pond versus unwanted afternoon evaporation.  If a dog or a person should fall through the glass floats (and if they don\u2019t boil!) they can push the floats down and get right out to the shore.  Tempered glass is surprisingly cheap and it can last for decades.  The shape increases total sunlight collection.\nThe best way to cool a stream of water vapor is to send it up a tall mountain.  As air pressure goes down the stream cools.  Massive amounts of late night snowfall on top of the mountain can restore a multi-year mountain glacier and revitalize a mountaintop ski area.",

Warming is making eastern N.
