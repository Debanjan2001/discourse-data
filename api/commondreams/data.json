                                "description": " Richard Heinberg\nThis article is adapted from POWER: Limits and Prospects for Human Survival (New Society Publishers) by Richard Heinberg.\nClimate change is often incorrectly described as an isolated pollution issue. In this flawed framing, humanity has simply made a mistake in its choice of energy sources; the solution entails switching sources and building enough carbon-sucking machines to clear the atmosphere of polluting CO2. Only the political power of the fossil fuel companies prevents us from adopting this solution and ending our existential environmental crisis.\nReal climate progress will require the willingness of large swathes of the populace, especially in wealthy countries, to forgo forms of power they currently enjoy: comfort and convenience, the ability to travel far and fast, and the option to easily obtain a wide range of consumer products whose manufacture entails large inputs of energy and natural resources.\nBut techno-fixes (that is, technological solutions that circumvent the need for personal or cultural change) aren't working so far, and likely won't work in the future. That's because fossil fuels will be difficult to replace, and energy usage is central to our collective economic power.\nIn other words, power is the key to solving climate change\u2014but not necessarily in the way that many pundits claim. Solutions will not come just from defeating fossil fuel interests and empowering green entrepreneurs; real climate progress will require the willingness of large swathes of the populace, especially in wealthy countries, to forgo forms of power they currently enjoy: comfort and convenience, the ability to travel far and fast, and the option to easily obtain a wide range of consumer products whose manufacture entails large inputs of energy and natural resources.\nThis is not a feel-good message, but the longer we postpone grappling with power in this larger sense, the less successful we're likely to be in coming to terms with the climate threat.\nThe Big Picture: Power and Consequences\nWhy can there be no climate techno-fix? There are two routes to this conclusion. The first one meanders through the history of humans on Earth, revealing how each new technological or social innovation empowered some people over others, while often imposing a long-term environmental cost. The adoption of agriculture was a milestone on this path: it enabled more people to subsist in any given area, and it led to cities, kings, and slavery; further, in many places, plowing tended to deplete or ruin topsoil, and city-dwellers cut down nearby forests, leading to eventual societal collapse.\nBut the real show-stopper came much more recently. The adoption of fossil fuels gave humans the biggest jolt of empowerment ever: in just the last two centuries, our global population has grown eight-fold, and so has per capita energy consumption. Our modern way of life\u2014with cars, planes, supermarkets, tractors, trucks, electricity grids, and internet shopping\u2014is the result.\nClimate change is the shadow of this recent cavalcade of industriousness, since it results from the burning of fossil fuels, the main enablers of modern civilization. Nevertheless, rapidly increasing population and consumption levels are inherently unsustainable and are bringing about catastrophic environmental impacts on their own, even if we disregard the effects of carbon emissions. The accelerating depletion of resources, increasing loads of chemical pollution, and the hastening loss of wild nature are trends leading us toward ecological collapse, with economic and social collapse no doubt trailing close behind. Ditching fossil fuels will turn these trends around only if we also deal with the issues of population and consumption.\nThat's the big picture. However, the quest for a climate techno-fix also fails on its own terms\u2014that is, as a painless means of averting climate change while maintaining our current industrial economy and way of life. The rest of this essay deals with this second trail of evidence and logic, which requires a more detailed presentation. So: buckle up. Here we go.\nWhy Solar Panels Won't Save Consumerism\nMost energy analysts regard solar and wind as the best candidates to substitute for fossil fuels in electrical power generation (since nuclear is too expensive and too risky, and would require too much time for build-out; and hydro is capacity constrained). But these \"renewables\" are not without challenges. While sunlight and wind are themselves renewable, the technologies we use to capture them aren't: they're constructed of non-renewable materials like steel, silicon, concrete, and rare earth minerals, all of which require energy for mining, transport, and transformation. These materials are also depleting, and many will be difficult or impossible to recycle.\nSunlight and wind are intermittent: we cannot control when the sun will shine or the wind will blow. Therefore, to ensure constant availability of power, these sources require some combination of four strategies:\nToday the world uses only about 20 percent of its final energy in the form of electricity. The other 80 percent of energy is used in the forms of solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels. A transition away from fossil fuels will entail the electrification of much of that other 80 percent of energy usage, which includes most transportation and key industrial processes. However, many uses of energy, such as aviation and the making of cement for concrete, will be difficult or especially costly to electrify. In principle, the electrification conundrum could be overcome by powering aviation and high-heat industrial processes with synfuels. However, doing this at scale would require a massive infrastructure of pipelines, storage tanks, carbon capture devices, and chemical synthesis plants that would essentially replicate much of our current natural gas and oil supply system.\nMachine-based carbon removal and sequestration methods work in the laboratory, but would need staggering levels of investment in order to be deployed at a meaningful scale, and it's unclear who would pay for them. These methods also use a lot of energy, and, when full lifecycle emissions are calculated, it appears that more emissions are often generated than are captured. The best carbon capture-and-sequestration responses appear instead to consist of various methods of ecosystem restoration and soil regeneration. These strategies would also reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions. But they would require a near-complete rethinking of food systems and land management.\nNot long ago I collaborated with a colleague, David Fridley, of the Energy Analysis Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to look closely at what a full transition to a solar-wind economy would mean (our efforts resulted in the book Our Renewable Future). We concluded that it will constitute an enormous job, requiring tens of trillions of dollars in investment. In fact, the task may be next to impossible\u2014if we attempt to keep the overall level of societal energy use the same, or expand it to fuel further economic growth. David and I concluded:\nWe citizens of industrialized nations will have to change our consumption patterns. We will have to use less overall and adapt our use of energy to times and processes that take advantage of intermittent abundance. Mobility will suffer, so we will have to localize aspects of production and consumption. And we may ultimately forgo some things altogether. If some new processes (e.g., solar or hydrogen-sourced chemical plants) are too expensive, they simply won't happen. Our growth-based, globalized, consumption-oriented economy will require significant overhaul.\nThe essence of the problem with a climate techno-fix is this: nearly everything we need to do to solve global warming (including building new low-emissions electrical generation capacity, and electrifying energy usage) requires energy and money. But society is already using all the energy and money it can muster in order to do the things that society wants and needs to do (extract resources, manufacture products, transport people and materials, provide health care and education, and so on). If we take energy and money away from those activities in order to fund a rapid energy transition on an unprecedented scale, then the economy will contract, people will be thrown out of work, and many folks will be miserable. On the other hand, if we keep doing all those things at the current scale while also rapidly building a massive alternative infrastructure of solar panels, wind turbines, battery banks, super grids, electric cars and trucks, electrified industrial equipment, and synthetic fuel factories, the result will be a big pulse of energy usage that will significantly increase carbon emissions over the short term (10 to 20 years), since the great majority of the energy currently available for the project must be derived from fossil fuels.\nIt takes energy to make solar panels, wind turbines, electric cars, and new generations of industrial equipment of all kinds. For a car with an internal combustion engine (ICE), 10 percent of lifetime energy usage occurs in the manufacturing stage. For an electric car, roughly 40 percent of energy usage occurs in manufacturing, and emissions during this stage are 15 percent greater than for an ICE car (over the entire lifetime of the e-car, emissions are about half those of the gasoline guzzler). With solar panels and wind turbines, energy inputs and carbon emissions are similarly front-loaded to the manufacturing phase; energy output and emissions reduction (from offsetting other electricity generation) come later. Replacing a very high percentage of our industrial infrastructure and equipment quickly would therefore entail a historically large burst of energy usage and carbon emissions. By undertaking a rapid energy transition, while also maintaining or even expanding current levels of energy usage for the \"normal\" purpose of economic growth, we would be defeating our goal of reducing emissions now\u2014even though we would be working toward the goal of reducing emissions later.\nThe only way out of the dilemma arising from the energy and emissions cost of the transition is to reduce substantially the amount of energy we are using for \"normal\" economic purposes.\nMany folks nurture the happy illusion that we can do it all\u2014continue to grow the economy while also funding the energy transition\u2014by assuming that the problem is only money (if we find a way to pay for it, then the transition can be undertaken with no sacrifice). This illusion can be maintained only by refusing to acknowledge the stubborn fact that all activity, including building alternative energy generators and carbon capture machinery, requires energy.\nThe only way out of the dilemma arising from the energy and emissions cost of the transition is to reduce substantially the amount of energy we are using for \"normal\" economic purposes\u2014for resource extraction, manufacturing, transportation, heating, cooling, and industrial processes\u2014both so that we can use that energy for the transition (building solar panels and electric vehicles), and so that we won't have to build as much new infrastructure. Increased energy efficiency can help reduce energy usage without giving up energy services, but many machines (LED lights, electric motors) and industrial processes are already highly efficient, and further large efficiency gains in those areas are unlikely. We would achieve an efficiency boost by substituting direct electricity generators (solar and wind) for inherently inefficient heat-to-electricity generators (natural gas and coal power plants); but we would also be introducing new inefficiencies into the system via battery-based electricity storage and hydrogen or synfuels production. In the end, the conclusion is inescapable: actual reductions in energy services would be required in order to transition away from fossil fuels without creating a significant short-term burst of emissions. Some energy and climate analysts other than David Fridley and myself\u2014such as Kevin Anderson, Professor of Energy and Climate Change at the University of Manchester\u2014have reached this same conclusion independently.\nEnergy is inextricably related to power. Thus, if society voluntarily reduces its energy usage by a significant amount in order to minimize climate impacts, large numbers of people will likely experience this as giving up power in some form\u2014whether physical, social, or economic.\nIt can't be emphasized too much: energy is essential to all economic activity. An economy can grow continuously only by employing more energy (unless energy efficiency can be increased substantially, and further gains in efficiency can continue to be realized in each succeeding year\u2014a near-impossibility over the long run, since investments in making processes more efficient typically see diminishing returns over time). World leaders demand more economic growth in order to fend off unemployment and other social ills. Thus, in effect, everyone is counting on having more energy in the future, not less.\nA few well-meaning analysts and pundits try to avoid the climate-energy-economy dilemma by creating scenarios in which renewable energy saves the day simply by becoming dramatically cheaper than energy from fossil fuels; or by ignoring the real costs of dealing with energy intermittency in solar and wind power generation. Some argue that we have to fight climate change by becoming even more powerful than we already are\u2014by geoengineering the atmosphere and oceans and thus taking full control of the planet, thereby acting like gods. And some business and political leaders simply deny that climate change is a problem; therefore, no action is required. I would argue that all of these people are deluding themselves and others.\nDo the Right Thing\u2014Even if It's Hard\nProblems ignored usually don't go away. And not all problems can be solved without sacrifice. If minimizing climate change really does require substantially reducing world energy usage, then policy makers should be discussing how to do this fairly and with as little negative impact as possible. The longer we delay that discussion, the fewer palatable options will be left.\nThe stakes could hardly be higher. If emissions continue, the result will be the failure of ecosystems, massive impacts on economies, widespread human misery and migration, and unpredictable disruptions to political systems. The return of famine as a familiar feature of human existence is a very real likelihood.\nIt's easy to see why people would wish to avoid giving up social, political, economic, and physical power to the degree that's necessary in order to deal with climate change. Fighting entrenched power is a contentious activity, often a dangerous one. People with power don't like threats to it, and they often fight back.\nThat's why environmentalists like to choose their battles. The fossil fuel industry is wealthy and formidable, but at least it's an enemy that's easy to identify, and a lot of people already feel critical of the oil and gas companies for a variety of reasons (gasoline is too expensive, oil pipelines cause pollution, and so on).\nBut not all roadblocks to climate solutions are attributable to the oil companies. The rest of us are also implicated, though to greatly varying degrees depending on where we live and how much we consume. Our whole modern consumerist way of life, the essence of our economic system, is at fault. Unless we're willing to give up some of our power over nature\u2014our power to extract and transform resources and deliver the goods that we have come to rely on\u2014then we're destined to careen from one disaster to the next until our worst fears are realized.\nIt's understandable why most environmentalists frame global warming the way they do. It makes solutions seem easier to achieve. But if we're just soothing ourselves while failing to actually stave off disaster, or even to understand our problems properly, what's the point?\nThe only real long-range solution to climate change centers on reining in human physical, social, and economic power dramatically, but in ways that preserve human dignity, autonomy, and solidarity. That's more daunting than any techno-fix. But this route has the singular advantage that, if we follow it intelligently and persistently, we will address a gamut of social and environmental problems at once. In the end, it's the only path to a better, safer future.\n Richard Heinberg\nRichard Heinberg is a senior fellow at the Post Carbon Institute and the author of thirteen books, including his most recent: \"Our Renewable Future: Laying the Path for One Hundred Percent Clean Energy\" (2016).

                                "description": " Steven Singer\nWe have faced tough times before.\nWorld wars, famines, pandemics, economic ruin.\nBut in each of these disasters, the majority of people thought they had somewhere to turn for knowledge and advice.\nWe had trusted authorities to tell us what to do, to counsel us how to handle these seemingly insurmountable disasters.\nThe fact that just six corporations own 90% of the media outlets in the country skew coverage to what's in the best interests of big business.\nToday many of us face the Covid-19 pandemic feeling there are few sources to believe in\u2013and that more than anything else\u2013is why we are having such a difficult time coming together to overcome this crisis.\nThe media, government, science, religion\u2013none hold a central place of confidence in most people's lives. So when tough decisions about health and safety come into play, many of us aren't sure what to do.\nThis wasn't always the case.\nLook back to World War II.\nNot only did we defeat fascism but new vaccines put a wallop on illness and disease.\nWhen we entered the fray, the US government organized new research initiatives targeting influenza, bacterial meningitis, bacterial pneumonia, measles, mumps, neurotropic diseases, tropical diseases and acute respiratory diseases.\nAnd because there was an immense trust in government\u2013after all, as a nation we had been attacked together as one at Pearl Harbor\u2013there was enormous trust in these initiatives.\nBefore World War II, soldiers died more often of disease than of battle injuries. The ratio of disease-to-battle casualties was approximately 5-to-1 in the Spanish-American War and 2-to-1 in the Civil War. In World War I, we were able to reduce casualties due to disease through better sanitation efforts, but we could not protect troops from the 1918 influenza pandemic. During that outbreak, flu accounted for roughly half of US military casualties in Europe.\nMuch of the groundwork for innovation in vaccinations had already been laid before WWII. However, it was the organization of the war effort and the trust both the civilian and military population had in government that catapulted us ahead.\nI'm not ignoring that some of this trust was misplaced. The US government has never been fully trustworthy\u2013just ask the Asian American population forced into internment camps. However, the general feeling at the time that the government was a force for good, that we were all in this together and we all had to do our part had a vast effect on how we handled this crisis.\nToday that kind of trust is gone.\nIn some ways that's a good thing. It could be argued that \"The Greatest Generation\" put too much faith in government and the following years showed why too credulous belief in the good will of our leaders was unearned and unhealthy.\nFrom Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal to Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct to George W. Bush lying us into a war of choice to Barack Obama's neoliberalism to Donald Trump's gross mismanagement and blatant racism\u2013we can never go back to a WWII mentality.\nSkepticism of government is kind of like seasoning. A certain amount is a good thing, but the inability to trust even government's most basic ability to take care of its citizens and function in any meaningful way is hugely detrimental.\nAnd this earned distrust has seeped into just about every source of possible certitude that might have helped us survive the current crisis.\nThe media used to be considered the fourth estate\u2013one of the most important pillars of our society. After all, the freedom of information is essential to the free exercise of democracy.\nHowever, the erosion of impartiality has been going on since at least the 1980s when the FCC under President Ronald Reagan abolished the Fairness Doctrine. Since 1949 this had required the media to present both sides' of opinions. In 1987 a Democratic Congress passed a bill to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine but it was vetoed by Reagan.\nThis, along with the rise of talk radio and the insistence that news departments turn a profit, lead directly to the creation of more biased reporting skewed to a particular audience\u2013Fox News and Sinclair Broadcast Group being the most prominent.\nThe fact that just six corporations own 90% of the media outlets in the country skew coverage to what's in the best interests of big business. These corporations are GE, Newscorp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner and CBS.\nFew people feel they can trust the news anymore. They turn to the Internet, social media, Twitter and other sources that often are just echo chambers for what they already believe.\nThe irony is not lost on me that you are reading a blog by a public school teacher, not a professional journalist. But my aim is to use my experience in education to inform the debate.\nIt's just too bad that I'm often forced to report the news when traditional news sources drops the ball.\nAgain skepticism of mass media is a good thing, but we should at least be able to count on the press as a reliable source of facts. However, these days few facts are free from bias, spin and editorial comment.\nEven science is not immune.\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) made several blunders handling this pandemic which hurt the organization's credibility.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, the organization refused to acknowledge and later emphasize the airborne spread of the virus. It took until May 2021 for the organization to fully recognize that fact.\nAnother blunder was the guidelines on what counts as \"close contact.\" It went from \"within 6 feet\" to \"within 3 feet\", and the duration went from 30 minutes consecutively to 30 minutes cumulatively. It's not so much that the evidence changed, but that political pressure forced the CDC to lower its standards.\nWorld scientific consensus now is that the coronavirus is capable of airborne spread without close contact between two people. Airborne droplets can linger in the air indoors and infect any number of people from one superspreading host subject.\nThe CDC's advice on close contact is based on old scientific research that just isn't as good as modern experiments.\nAnd the organization has misjudged so much more from the importance of masking (at first they said it wasn't important, now they say it is important), whether children can catch the virus (at first they said this was unlikely and now they admit it happens but is often asymptomatic), whether Covid spreads in schools (they used to say the limited protections in place at schools made this unlikely and now they admit it is happening), etc.\nOne could argue that these were simple mistakes that have changed as better science comes in. However, in each case they appear to have initially been politically motivated and justified with limited or flawed studies that could not continue to be supported as new data came in.\nAt first the CDC told us that masking wasn't important not because it was true, but to hide a shortage of masks that needed to be prioritized for medical staff. These needs are understandable, but hiding the truth and then changing your messaging doesn't engender trust.\nMisinformation about the impact of Covid on children was an attempt to keep schools open and stop the economy from shutting down as parents were unable to work. Not only did this put children at risk for economic gain, it has contributed to the current refusal of so many people to follow CDC guidelines about reopening schools.\nWhy do so many people refuse to have their children wear masks at school? Why is there so much vaccine hesitancy? Why anxiety about reopening plans that focus on close contacts?\nThe CDC owns a lot of the responsibility because it has repeatedly earned our distrust.\nThis isn't to say everything coming from them is dubious. I think the guidelines the CDC has put in place for the current school year are supported by the facts.\nI think there is evidence that people need to wear masks in schools. I think we need to vaccinate as many people as possible.\nBut these are just bare minimums.\nI think the CDC is still focusing too much on the economic impact of its guidelines when it should be solely focused on the health and safety of students, staff and the community.\nThis is not a time for scientists to be playing politics.\nWe need them to be as transparent as possible\u2013as trustworthy as they can be.\nUnfortunately, the erosion of institutional credibility at so many levels has become a cycle to itself.\nAt multiple levels, sources that should be bedrock have become wet sand.\nThe federal government has not taken enough action to keep people safe. State governments have not taken enough action\u2013and some have even taken action to prevent safety.\nEven at the local level, many school boards have cowardly refused to put in place mask or vaccine mandates.\nIt is the systematic breakdown of a society.\nWe have few places left we can trust.\nAnd that is why we are fractured and scared.\nWe don't know what to do to keep our loved ones safe.\nPeople seem forced to choose between taking the virus seriously and ignoring it.\nMany refuse to admit that it could hurt them. They think it's just the sniffles. Few healthy people die and they discount the potential longterm effects of catching it.\nThe US has only 4% of the world population but nearly a quarter of all Covid cases.\nThat's not a coincidence.\nIn large part, it's because we don't know how to combat the virus because we don't know who to trust.\nAnd the resulting credibility vacuum has enabled unscrupulous politicians, agents of chaos and other charlatans to position themselves as experts.\nWhen all information is equal, disinformation is king.\nThe solution to the pandemic may end up being easier than this riddle.\nHow our institutions can regain their credibility.\nEspecially when our politics doesn't allow them to be honest, and fewer people are even listening to them every day.\n Steven Singer\nSteven Singer is a husband, father, teacher, blogger and education advocate.

Nothing new here.\nI take a bit of an issue with the historical accuracy of the expression: \u201cNot only did we defeat fascism\u2026\u201d as it implies that it was the US who defeated fascism. The US entered the 2nd world war by the very end of it, after European countries and societies (and including especially Russia) had organized and sustained an incredible resistance, with heavy losses and good strategies that had weakened the Germans/Italians. Don\u2019t know much about the Asian continent\u2026but know enough about Hiroshima, not to call it a victory.\nAnd besides, if you consider the state of the population of African origin in the US before, during, and after the 2nd world war (till mid sixties), one can credibly argue that fascism at home was far from being defeated.",

The U.S. had less assistance in the Pacific Front, unlike the European Front with the British, Russians, etc.\nAll in all, to nuture true understanding of the horrible things done to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a person really needs to talk to the many men and women who valiantly served in the Pacific theatre during WWII. It really wasn\u2019t \" a day at the beach \" though many humans died on one during the longtime carnage. I was lucky and blessed to know some of those intimately involved in these historical conflagrations. Their sacrifices have aged well even if our national sense of Pax America has really \" gone south \", as the smartypants say.\nThe Euro-Centric nature of America\u2019s short sighted and tunneled vision is rather understandable. However, anyone able to rub two brain cells together knows The Big Game regarding U. S. self-interest was always going to play out in \" the Asian continent \". China after 1948, anyone?\nThe heroes I know who served and gave all (even if they lived) in the Pacific theatre knew the score, afterwards.

                                "description": " Kenny Stancil\nProgressives on Wednesday applauded Democratic Reps. Mondaire Jones, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib for unveiling a bill that would prevent Wall Street from continuing to bankroll fossil fuels, the primary driver of the climate emergency.\n\"For too long, our federal government has looked the other way while our nation's largest banks bankroll the dirtiest fossil fuel projects, exacerbating the climate crisis and setting us up for a massive, climate-induced economic collapse.\"\u2014Rep. Ayanna Pressley\nThe Fossil Free Finance Act (pdf) would require the Federal Reserve to mandate, via regulation or guidance, that all banks and other financial insitutions with more than $50 billion in assets phase out the funding of\u00a0coal, oil, and gas extraction as well as industries linked to deforestation, in accordance with science-based targets for slashing carbon pollution.\nIn an effort to meet U.S. obligations under the Paris agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half this decade and eliminate them by midcentury, the legislation would prohibit the financing of new or expanded fossil fuel projects after 2022 and all fossil fuel projects after 2030.\n\"The climate crisis poses an existential threat to every aspect of our society, including our economy and financial system,\" Jones (N.Y.)\u00a0said in a statement.\u00a0\"As climate disasters grow in frequency and intensity, we can no longer afford to stand by while big banks and other financial institutions invest trillions in the companies fueling the climate crisis.\"\nCiting a\u00a0report released earlier this year by a coalition of environmental groups, Tlaib (Mich.)\u00a0noted that \"over the last five years, financial institutions under the Federal Reserve's supervision provided trillions in direct fossil fuel financing\u2014and each new project brings us closer to the brink.\"\n\"Our planet is burning,\" Tlaib continued. \"My residents deserve to breathe clean air. For over a decade, Wayne County, Michigan has not met the Clean Air Act standards, leaving us with high rates of asthma and respiratory illnesses.\"\nEchoing her colleagues, Pressley (Mass.)\u00a0said:\u00a0\"For too long, our federal government has looked the other way while our nation's largest banks bankroll the dirtiest fossil fuel projects, exacerbating the climate crisis and setting us up for a massive, climate-induced economic collapse. That must change.\"\n\"It's time for a financial system that is truly safe, sound, and just,\" Pressley continued. \"One that recognizes the existential threat posed by climate change and takes aggressive action to save our economy, save our planet, and save lives.\"\nThe Fossil Free Finance Act was introduced amid a heated battle over the future of U.S. central banking, with current Fed Chair Jerome Powell's tenure set to expire in February 2022.\nPowell, a Republican appointee of former President Donald Trump with connections to the private equity industry, has received praise from some economists for his response to the Covid-19 pandemic and corresponding economic crisis\u2014namely, his embrace of monetary policies that aim to keep unemployment low instead of only focusing on price stability.\nNonetheless, progressives\u2014including the three co-sponsors of Fossil Free Finance Act as well as Reps. Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)\u2014have argued that Powell's\u00a0weak approach to financial regulation\u00a0and\u00a0unwillingness to curb climate risk\u00a0should disqualify him from another four-year term, and urged President Joe Biden to appoint fresh leadership at the nation's central bank.\n\"As climate disasters grow in frequency and intensity, we can no longer afford to stand by while big banks and other financial institutions invest trillions in the companies fueling the climate crisis.\"\u2014Rep. Mondaire Jones\nAccording to a\u00a0report\u00a0released last month by Oil Change International, the Fed under Powell has \"worked to maintain and increase fossil fuel finance from the United States.\" The financing of coal, oil, and gas extraction under the Fed's supervision persists despite recent\u00a0reports\u00a0from the International Energy Agency and the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, both of which\u00a0warned\u00a0that averting catastrophic levels of global warming requires rapidly moving away from fossil fuels.\n\"The Federal Reserve's role is not to surrender our planet to corporate polluters and shepherd our financial system to its destruction,\" Tlaib said Wednesday. \"The Federal Reserve's role is to act.\"\nThe Fossil Free Finance Act came the same day a new analysis revealed that just one country in the world, Gambia, has enacted policies compatible with limiting global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\u00a0\nIt was also introduced just two days after thousands of scientists demanded\u2014ahead of the ongoing U.N. General Assembly and COP 26, which kicks off on October 31 in Scotland\u2014that governments negotiate and adopt a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, a binding international pact to achieve a swift and just transition by immediately halting the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure, phasing out existing fossil fuel production, and investing in a plan to provide equitable global access to 100% renewable energy.\nAccording to Jones, the Fossil Free Finance Act\u2014endorsed by a dozen progressive advocacy organizations including 350.org, Friends of the Earth, the Revolving Door Project, and the Sunrise Movement\u2014\"will\u00a0end the era of unmitigated emissions financing and ensure financial institutions do their part to address our climate crisis before it's too late.\"\nYevgeny Shrago, policy counsel at Public Citizen's Climate Program, commended the bill, which he said\u00a0\"sends a powerful message that Congress won't accept the Federal Reserve's failure to do its job.\"\n\"The agency has tremendous power to protect the financial system from the effects of the climate crisis and to make sure it's prepared for the coming clean energy transition,\" Shrago continued. \"But just like with the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed is standing by as banks increase their risky bets on toxic assets.\"\n\"We applaud the sponsors of this bill,\" he added, \"for addressing this threat and directing the Fed to use the tools at its disposal to protect vulnerable communities from the financial impacts of the climate crisis, instead of safeguarding Wall Street profits.\"\n"

The big banks are not ecological saviors and never will be unless by overwhelming force.  When people vote for one of these oil addicted war parties they are voting to continue to put money and military might above the biosphere. I know a few Democrats hearts are in the right place but they are tied to an organization that barely tolerates them and the society is under the spell of capitalist  and 2 party propaganda.  If we have any hope of human survival it will be because the weather itself will tear apart the social fabric and infrastructure and the chaos that follows will turn us toward local self government, communalism  and permaculture.",

The monetary system is the problem, because there is always more debt than money (more owed than what exists), so constant growth is required to pay the debt. That means more things need to be monetized, turned into a commodity. What was previously free now needs to be for sale to pay back the debt. In our system of accounting, a tree has no value, as long as it remains in the forest; it only has \u2018value\u2019 once it\u2019s been chopped down, and a price has been placed on its human utility.\nUnderlying the usury monetary system is Cartesian dualism which believes that humans are actually separate, independent from everything else, including their own bodies (\u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d). All our modern institutions proceed from this viewpoint. Humanity is in its adolescence, recklessly pushing against the limits to figure out how powerful we truly are. There are more mature viewpoints that see systems within systems, all mutually affecting each other through relationships and scale.\nWe are not above everything else. We exist on a mid-scale between the highest and lowest. We are in transition\u2014a rite of passage\u2014together. We aren\u2019t going to control our way out of this.

                                "description": " Stephen Zunes\nOn September 11, I was woken in my California home with an urgent call from Martha Honey, then-director of Foreign Policy In Focus, telling me to turn on my television to view the burning towers.\nI watched them both fall, along with the announcements of the attack on the Pentagon and crash in Pennsylvania. I had visited war zones on several continents, but nothing could have prepared me for the horror inflicted upon my own country. Unfortunately, I barely allowed myself to grieve over the horror due to my fear\u2014which ended up being tragically prescient\u2014of the far greater terror my government would unleash on the Middle East as a response.\nThe more the United States had militarized the region, the less secure the American people had become.\nAs a Middle East specialist, I engaged in scores of interviews and wrote a number of widely circulated articles in the days, weeks and months that followed. Both out of respect for those killed and their loved ones as well as my own deep-seated feelings of anger and horror, I did not mince words regarding the perpetrators of the attacks and their supporters. I even defended the right of the United States and its allies to engage in (a limited and targeted) military response to the very real threat posed by al-Qaeda. However, I also thought that it was critical to examine what may have motivated the horrific attacks, which I found important not only in preventing future terrorism, but also to avoid policies that could further exacerbate the threat.\nMy argument was that the more the United States had militarized the region, the less secure the American people had become. I noted how all the sophisticated weaponry, brave soldiers, and brilliant military leadership the United States possessed would do little good if there were hundreds of millions of people in the Middle East and beyond who hated us. Even though only a small percentage of the population supported Osama bin Laden's methods, I argued, there would still be enough people to maintain dangerous terrorist networks as long as his grievances resonated with large numbers of people.\nI went on to explain how, as most Muslims recognized, bin Laden was not an authority on Islam. He was, however, a businessman by training, who\u2014like any shrewd businessman\u2014knew how to take a popular fear or desire and use it to sell a product: in this case, anti-American terrorism. The grievances expressed in his manifestos\u2014the ongoing U.S. military presence in the Gulf, the humanitarian consequences of the U.S.-led sanctions against Iraq, U.S. support for the Israeli government, and U.S. backing of autocratic Arab regimes\u2014had widespread appeal in that part of the world. I quoted British novelist John le Carre's observation that, \"What America longs for at this moment, even more that retribution, is more friends and fewer enemies.\"\nI reiterated how there was nothing karmic about the events of 9/11, but that history had demonstrated how the United States did not become a target for terrorists because of its values, as President Bush and others claimed, but because it had strayed from its professed values of freedom, democracy, and rule of law in implementing its policies in the Middle East. Furthermore, I argued that a policy based more on the promotion of human rights, international law, and sustainable development, and less on arms transfers, air strikes, punitive sanctions, and support for occupation armies and dictatorial governments, would make Americans a lot safer.\nI repeatedly emphasized that, whatever the failings of a government in its foreign policy, no country deserves to experience such a large-scale loss of innocent lives as the United States experienced on 9/11. Yet I also stressed that the hope of stopping extremists who might resort to such heinous acts in the future rested in part on the willingness of Americans to recognize what gave rise to what veteran journalist Robert Fisk described as \"the wickedness and awesome cruelty of a crushed and humiliated people.\"\nTo raise these uncomfortable questions about U.S. foreign policy was difficult for many Americans, particularly in the aftermath of the attacks. Indeed, many were afraid to ask the right questions because they feared the answers. Still, I was convinced that it could not have been more important or timely.\nRaising such questions was not popular, however. Detectives investigating a crime trying to establish a motive are generally not accused of defending the criminals. Fire inspectors inspecting the ruins of a building for the cause of the blaze are not accused of defending its destruction. Yet I found myself, along with scores of other Middle Eastern scholars, being attacked for supposedly defending terrorism.\nWithin a few months, I found\u00a0 out that a dossier about me\u2014along with seven other professors specializing in the Middle East\u2014had been compiled by Campus Watch, a project of the right-wing Middle East Forum, led by the Islamaphobic intellectual and occasional Bush administration adviser Daniel Pipes. The list of \"anti-American\" professors who had the audacity to raise concerns over certain U.S. policies also included some of the top scholars in the field, including John Esposito at Georgetown, Joel Beinin at Stanford, Ian Lustick at the University of Pennsylvania, Rashid Khalidi of the University of Chicago, and Edward Said at Columbia.\nVarious manifestations of this Campus Watch claim that I had said that 9/11 was \"our fault\" soon made its way to Fox News, MSNBC, radio talk shows throughout the nation and even into my short biographical entry in Wikipedia.\nSoon thereafter, a number of my speaking invitations were rescinded. For example, I received a last-minute cancellation of my scheduled presentation on international law at the Arizona Bar Association's annual convention, which had been scheduled six months earlier, following the director and his board of governors being told I was \"anti-American.\"\nOthers were altered. The provost of Hofstra University, where I was scheduled to give a plenary address on U.S. Middle East policy and international law at a peace studies conference, successfully demanded that the length of my presentation be substantially reduced and that organizers bring in a prominent neoconservative attorney and Breitbart contributor to follow me.\nOn Fox News, Sean Hannity claimed that Campus Watch was doing \"American parents a favor\" by citing \"the extreme left-wing agenda like Mr. Zunes\" so that parents, \"when they're making decisions about whether or not to send their kids to Mr. Zunes' college like the University of San Francisco, they'll have at least some knowledge of where these people that will be educating their children are coming from.\"\nBeing tenured at a university with applications for admission steadily growing every year, I was not worried about the USF administration's response when the phone calls and emails from worried parents and alumni began pouring in in response to Hannity's statement. However, following the 9/11 attacks, Middle Eastern scholars in less secure situations had to think twice about publicly raising questions about U.S. policy in the region.\nPerhaps more disturbingly, the attacks on Middle Eastern scholars were not limited to individuals who raised concerns over the Bush administration's policies, but the entire field of study. For example, Martin Kramer of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy argued in his book, Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America, that \"The field is pervaded by hostility to American aims, interests, and power in the Middle East, and peopled by tenured radicals.\"\nRegional specialists, given our unique understanding of parts of the world which few policymakers know firsthand, can play an invaluable role in the foreign policy sphere. Middle East scholars from across the ideological spectrum were almost uniformly opposed to a U.S. invasion of Iraq and other Bush administration policies post-9/11, because we had a good sense of the tragic consequences that would likely result. And yet, like Southeast Asia scholars 40 years earlier, who forewarned the tragedy that would unfold by a U.S. war in Vietnam, we were ridiculed and ignored and found our loyalty to our country questioned.\nThe United States, like other great powers, has made many tragic mistakes in its foreign policy, but never had the stakes been higher. Whatever crimes our government has committed in the past in Central America or Southeast Asia, no Nicaraguans or Vietnamese ever flew airplanes into buildings. By attacking the credibility of Middle East specialists who understood the dangerous ramifications of U.S. policy, it ended up being the right\u2014not the left\u2014which was endangering our national security.\nIndeed, my decision to become a more public intellectual following the 9/11 tragedy was motivated by my understanding of how U.S. policy in the Middle East was putting all of us in danger, and by my desire to do my part to make America safer.\nAs the tragedies of Afghanistan and Iraq show, and as anti-Americanism in the Islamic world has only grown, the consequences of Americans unwilling to learn the lessons of 9/11 have become strikingly clear.\nIn the months leading up to the October 2002 vote authorizing the invasion of Iraq, I provided extensive material to a number of Congressional offices of prominent Democrats raising serious questions regarding the administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had somehow reconstituted his \"weapons of mass destruction\" and offensive delivery systems, or that he had operational ties to al-Qaeda. I also provided these offices and committee staff with what later proved to be rather prescient predictions of the disaster that would result from a U.S. invasion and occupation.\nI later learned that a number of these offices failed to take my arguments seriously and successfully resisted requests that I be allowed to testify before relevant Congressional committees because they had heard I was \"extreme\" and \"far left\" in my views.\nOther Middle East scholars had similar experiences. As chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Joe Biden refused to allow hardly any of us to testify, instead stacking the witness list with supporters of the invasion who not only made the false claim that Iraq was amassing a large stockpile of \"weapons of mass destruction,\" but insisted that U.S. occupation forces in Iraq would be \"welcomed as liberators.\"\nHad we been able to testify, we would have argued\u2014among other things\u2014that a U.S. invasion and occupation would encourage the rise of even larger and more extreme manifestations of Salafist extremism, as has indeed been manifested in the rises of the so-called Islamic State, an Iraqi-led group which was a direct consequence of that tragic war.\nAttacks against scholars raising critical concerns in the post-9/11 era did not cause most of us to lose our jobs or stop us from speaking out. However, it did cause political leaders, journalists, and millions of ordinary citizens to not trust some of the country's most critical intellectual resources in formulating policies in subsequent decades.\nAs the tragedies of Afghanistan and Iraq show, and as anti-Americanism in the Islamic world has only grown, the consequences of Americans unwilling to learn the lessons of 9/11 have become strikingly clear.\n Stephen Zunes\nStephen Zunes is a Professor of Politics and International Studies at the University of San Francisco, where he serves as coordinator of the program in Middle Eastern Studies. Recognized as one the country\u2019s leading scholars of U.S. Middle East policy and of strategic nonviolent action, Professor Zunes serves as a senior policy analyst for the Foreign Policy in Focus project of the Institute for Policy Studies, an associate editor of Peace Review, a contributing editor of Tikkun, and co-chair of the academic advisory committee for the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict.\n"

And what should have been a surprise to absolutely no one, this is exactly what happened. To recall a Latin expression, cui bono? The answer to that question is that it would be the United States and Israel that benefits. But yet Zunes, an expert on foreign policy, for some reason never raises that issue.\nIt would be helpful if Zunes would read the works of David Ray Griffin as that would help him in gaining a better understanding on this topic.",

And it exposes the fact that he has not got much to offer ahead of Glasgow.\"\nWith China and the United States now the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions and leading superpowers, it has long been an aim of the climate movement to intensify cooperation between the two nations as a way to jumpstart the necessary global transition to a fossil-fuel-free energy economy. But critics of AUKUS warn that this fresh antagonism toward China\u2014as the climate crisis worsens and the scientific community's warnings reach ever-higher levels of alarm\u2014is coming at the worst possible time.\nGerard Toal, a professor of political geography at Virginia Tech, said Friday that the AUKUS deal represents an \"imperial fantasy focused on the wrong threat\" and \"is a disaster for [the] possibility of collective action against climate change.\"\nMeanwhile, Green U.K. MP Caroline Lucas, a longtime advocate for far-reaching climate action, warned that \"reaching a positive outcome [during COP 26] just got a whole lot harder.\"\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Laurence Tubiana, chief executive of the European Climate Foundation and a former French diplomat who oversaw the Paris climate talks in 2015, said that the world needs \"clarity and solidarity\" heading into Glasgow.\n\"The climate crisis will impact every country, regardless of GDP,\" she said. \"Climate diplomacy relies upon an understanding of the scale of the crisis and the self-interest states have in strong and robust climate action.\"\n\"It is not a question of deals or transactions; it is a common fight,\" Tubiana added. \"Further success is predicated on a repaired U.S.-China relationship, but also upon a commitment to multilateralism across the board if we are to keep the spirit of the Paris agreement alive.\"\n"

There approaches, even sooner than I expected, a chain-reaction of heating from triggered methane releases, which will make human emissions pale in significance.\nI\u2019m the last one to approve a message that fuel-efficiency of your car and home is getting less and less significant. But it\u2019s a physical reality of huge subterranean and submarine methane stores all around, like a planetary poison pill we\u2019re in the process of swallowing.\nSo I\u2019m sincerely confused, looking for help. The disaster appears already upon us, regardless of how old white alliances decide to squirm. Won\u2019t much help. Or even hurt. Whatever.",

As a progressive, I abhor all authoritarian, undemocratic regimes and China has to be one of the worst. Those in power in China may call themselves communists but they are simply a fascist oligarchy that seeks to preserve its political power through censorship and state terror. Progressives, and Common Dreams, should not kneejerk parrot every propaganda line that comes out of China. The idea that China is somehow justified in refusing to cooperate on climate change just to get back at the USA, UK and Australia is ridiculous. They are already suffering far worse environmental problems than other developed countries. That they would destroy their future and that of the whole planet just to keep their silly little manmade islands in the South China Sea reveals exactly what kind of regime we are dealing with. Every time the Chinese oligarchy wants something, maybe Taiwan, maybe acquiescence to their sea grab in the South China Sea, auto-censorship by international Internet companies, or whatever, will they resort to this kind of climate brinksmanship? \u201cGive us what we want or else we\u2019ll churn out more CO2!\u201d Climate change is something that affects every country in the world including China.

                                "description": " David Orr\nThe sixth report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms yet again that we are rapidly destabilizing the climate and making the earth a more dangerous and biologically impoverished planet. No surprise; we've known this since the 1970s. The primary cause of the worsening situation, however, is not the combustion of fossil fuels, but the massive political dereliction that has allowed the bonfire to go on after we knew that it posed a potentially lethal threat to humankind. We have no precedent for malfeasance at this scale therefore we have no law, no accountability\u2014and so far\u2014no remedy.\nWithout rapid and coordinated global action to stabilize the climate below some all-too-near threshold the human experiment is in jeopardy.\nNo one is in jail for complicity in ecocide. The burning part is just a symptom of a half-century long political failure attributable in large part to the power of unprincipled and unaccountable money to override the public interest, including that in our own survival. As a result, the worst \"worst case\" scenarios are beginning to play out before our eyes. Commensurate to the scale of the problem, our leaders did not lead, public institutions did not act, media did not inform, social media pedaled lies, and conservative Courts protected power and wealth, ironically contributing to the most radical outcomes. All along our questions have been \"too puny for our circumstances;\" our ideas inadequate to the systemic challenges posed by a de-stabilizing climate and deteriorating ecosystems. Let's start with government and the broader subject of governance and political culture.\u00a0\nGoverning is a perennial human problem. As difficult as it has always been, however, it is about to become much harder in the transition from the Holocene to a different and more hostile planet. From the first tribal councils to the present, rulers everywhere could safely assume that\u2014whatever the weather\u2014the climate was a constant even if they knew nothing about how the planet functioned or even that they lived on a planet. That assumption no longer holds. Climate stability is declining, forcing weather patterns everywhere into chaos. Without rapid and coordinated global action to stabilize the climate below some all-too-near threshold the human experiment is in jeopardy. The change from the stable climate of the past 12,000 years to a less predictable and more capricious climate, will require significant changes in government and governing. The reasons are becoming clearer.\nFirst, the rate of planetary change is accelerating much faster than once predicted. The biogeochemical cycles of earth, particularly the carbon cycle, now set both the speed and the agenda for what governments will have to do to avoid calamity, preserve civilization, and adapt to hotter, drier, stormier conditions, rising seas, stressed ecosystems, and their social, political, and economic collateral effects.\u00a0\nSecond, a destabilizing climate is \"an everything issue\" affecting the full range of what governments at every level have been expected to do and more. Things long taken for granted, however, are now in jeopardy. Full shelves at the supermarket, electricity at the flip of a switch, clean water at the tap, economic growth, dependable supply chains, ecosystem services like pollination, relative safety in the streets, medical care, and someone to answer 911 calls. Accustomed to incremental solutions to smaller problems, governments will increasingly face cascading and interlinked large-scale problems. Success\u2014whatever that may mean\u2014will require designing systemic solutions, at all levels of government, that solve multiple problems without causing new ones. Security, for one, has meant spending trillions on weapons to fend off external threats, sometimes conjured by our own behavior as \"blowback.\" Climate change, however, will jeopardize the security of everyone closer to home as larger, more destructive storms, longer droughts, larger fires, declining farm productivity, pandemics in changing ecologies, societal breakdown, and so forth. The occurrence of multiple crises could stress our response capacity to the breaking point.\u00a0\u00a0\nThird, because of the long residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere and the massive amount of latent heat now stored in the oceans\u2014matters of physics and chemistry\u2014this is not a short-term crisis, but a \"long-emergency\" measured in the time required to re-stabilize the climate system and restore Earth's energy balance. Geoengineering the atmosphere would be, at best, a planetary version of Russian roulette. The upshot is that we must now become students of longevity: how to build institutions that are durable under prolonged stress and have the capacity for self-repair. The examples are few: Chinese Civilization, the Catholic Church, Oxford University, the U.S. Constitution, and ecosystems.\nFourth, as the chaos caused by a destabilizing climate grows, so too the tendency for violence. Fleeing uninhabitable homelands, a rising tide of climate refugees will stress international agencies and the stability of nations that may or may not be welcoming. The potential for international conflict will grow over the control of water and arable lands. Violence, insurrection, guerilla warfare, random killings are likely to increase. Despair will mount as well. The combination of violence and hopelessness will feed the appeal of authoritarian/Fascist governments promising quick and improbable solutions to problems solvable only with systemic changes.\nThe most important question we now face is whether we can quickly muster and then sustain the political will to govern wisely and well enough to prevent Earth's climate from spiraling out of control.\u00a0\nFifth, in a more chaotic climate the tools and machinery of governance, designed for simpler times and different conditions will not work as they once did. The use of subsidies, taxes, regulation, fiscal tools as well as public administration and agencies will have to be adapted to changing circumstances. In other words, the metrics by which government performance have been measured must now include the effects of public policies on climate stability and ecological resilience, including the damage we inflict on future generations. A significant fraction of the costs and burdens on central governments can be reduced by designing more robust, self-reliant, walkable and bikeable cities with community owned solar energy systems, local farming/food networks, and post-car transportation systems; cities becoming more like, say, Copenhagen than Los Angeles.\u00a0\nSixth, in a destabilizing climate many of the presumed beliefs and attitudes from the industrial era, including the imperative of economic growth and extreme individualism, are not well suited for conditions of climate chaos. For example, because we did not pay the full (external) costs of growth powered by fossil fuels, we were never as rich as we presumed ourselves to be. Instead, we offloaded costs on others elsewhere or at some other time. The unavoidable conclusion is that economies, domestic and global, must be redesigned to meet more rigorous standards including full-cost pricing, fairness within and between nations and generations, and sustainability within the limits of the earth, i.e. carrying capacity.\u00a0\nA safe transition through the long emergency ahead requires growth in human solidarity summarized as a change of pronouns and outlook from \"I,\" \"me,\" and \"mine\" to \"we,\" \"ours,\" and \"us,\" including future generations and other species. The most important question we now face is whether we can quickly muster and then sustain the political will to govern wisely and well enough to prevent Earth's climate from spiraling out of control.\u00a0\n David Orr\nDavid W.

The ease that certain humans glommed onto ways to be apart from Gaia, from agriculture and animal domestication leading to overgrazing, salt poisoning, and deserts. To mining for materials resulting in water pollution and deforestation. From rapid industrialization, and humans so easily adapting to becoming golems on assembly lines. It\u2019s telling to see those who resisted like the Luddites, the Amish, and all Indigenous peoples.\nCertain phrases in the article reflect this-the normality of \u201csupermarkets\u201d as being something we need to save, supply chains.\nBut when you walk as a ghost in an empty world, connected to a world full of wonders and fellow beings, it gives you power\u2026",

                                "description": " Mark Weisbrot\nThe world economy faces serious risks going forward: for example, an estimated $2.3 trillion in income is projected to be lost in 2022\u201325 due to vaccine inequity\u2014most of it in developing countries.\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to zero, and has created more than 3.6 trillion dollars since the pandemic began. Fiscal policy was also unprecedented, with a federal budget deficit of 15 percent of GDP last year, and projected at 13.4 percent for 2021. That is how we got increased unemployment benefits, an expanded child tax credit, unprecedented stimulus checks, expanded food stamps, and more, substantially lowering the US poverty rate.\nIn June, the World Food Program estimated an increase of 121 million people who have become \"acutely food insecure or at high risk\" since the pandemic began.\nBut billions of people live in low-and middle-income countries that do not have the same options. Since poverty is much more severe there, this is vastly more a matter of life and death. In June, the World Food Program estimated an increase of 121 million people who have become \"acutely food insecure or at high risk\" since the pandemic began. This is an \"unprecedented\" 81 percent increase; it could kill millions of people, especially children. Malnutrition in children significantly increases preventable deaths from other causes.\nThere is no central bank for the world economy, and no world currency, that can be used to help mobilize the kind of resources for the world that the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have created with their own currencies. But the IMF can do something that is similar, and it can save millions of lives.\nLast month the Fund issued $650 billion worth of an international reserve asset\u2014called Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)\u2014for all IMF member countries.\nUnder IMF rules, these can be exchanged for hard currencies, such as dollars or euros, by countries in need. SDRs are not loans, and do not have to be paid back; there are no conditions attached to them.\nOne striking feature of this innovation\u2014which was deployed in the world recession of 2009\u2014is that many countries that don't actually convert the SDRs to currency still benefit from them. Just by having more international reserves, they are less likely to face balance of payments crises, fiscal or credit crises, or deepening recessions when their economies slow.\nThese new international reserves also free up other resources within developing countries for essential imports like vaccines, medicine, and food. And they can be exchanged for hard currency as necessary.\nBut there is politics involved, and this can ruin everything. Steven Mnuchin, Trump's treasury secretary, immediately blocked the IMF from issuing SDRs when the Fund's managing director proposed it in March 2020. Congress can overrule Treasury, and so the House passed legislation last year to have the US government approve \"at least 2 trillion SDRs\"\u2014worth $2.8 trillion\u2014at the Fund.\nBut Republicans blocked the legislation in the Senate. When Biden took office, the new Treasury Department agreed, at the IMF, to about the most that they could approve without a vote of Congress. This was the $650 billion worth that the IMF issued last month.\nBut this $650 billion-equivalent issuance was not nearly enough to meet the needs that most of the world is facing, in order to save the lives of people who can be saved.\nThe US economy also gains from any SDR issuance, because our exports depend on demand from the rest of the world economy. The number of US export-related jobs lost to the world recession is estimated at more than 2 million; these will return sooner if the world economy recovers faster.\nSo members of Congress have come back, with legislation in both the House and Senate, to get the rest of what the House approved last year. It has passed the House again this year, but Republican leadership is still blocking it in the Senate.\nThere is no reason for anyone to make this a partisan issue. There is no budget issue or cost to the US government; SDRs are not foreign aid. Supporters of a larger SDR issuance have included hundreds of economists, former and current heads of state, and government ministers across the political spectrum. There are virtually no economists\u2014of any political persuasion\u2014who have said anything against it; that is because there are no significant downside risks. Organizations representing tens of millions of Americans\u2014including major religious organizations such as the US Conference of Catholic Bishops\u00a0\u2014\u00a0have supported the multitrillion dollar issuances passed by the US House of Representatives.\nOf course, the US is politically polarized right now, and this legislation has been introduced by Democrats. But just a few weeks ago, 19 Republican Senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, joined Democrats to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. That's real money. And former president Trump, who remains the most powerful Republican, urged them to vote no. (Trump has never said a word about SDRs.)\nNo senator is going to face a campaign attack commercial next year accusing them of supporting Special Drawing Rights. There has to be at least one Republican senator who will have the fortitude to support something that will create jobs in the US, save lives all over the world, and is costless to the US government.\n Mark Weisbrot\nMark Weisbrot is Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), in Washington, DC.

                                "description": " Alex Lawson,\u00a0 Alexandra Rojas\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-NY) was one of three Democrats who cast a pivotal no vote in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Rice shamefully voted against giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices as part of the $3.5 trillion Build Back Better package.\nDespite the setback, we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to give Medicare negotiating power to lower drug prices for everyone. And Pharma is scared.\nIt\u2019s hard to find a policy more popular with voters across the spectrum than taking on Pharma greed and lowering drug prices.\nPharma is so scared that they\u2019ve launched a massive campaign against giving Medicare negotiating power. Pharma\u2019s lobbying frenzy includes multi-million dollar TV ad buys and spending over $6 million from April to June of this year on lobbying (a 19% increase during the same time last year).\nAny politician who listens to Pharma and puts profits over people's lives deserves to wear that shame forever. That\u2019s why we have a mobile billboard in Rice\u2019s Long Island district to let her constituents know she betrayed them. Clearly, Rice needs a reminder that she works for the people of New York\u2019s fourth Congressional district, not Pharma.\nIt will come as no surprise that Rice (along with the other no voters Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA) and Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-OR)) is in the pockets of Pharma. Rice has received $84,259 from campaign contributions from pharmaceutical and health corporations during her congressional career. And Peters and Schrader have collectively taken an appalling $1.7 million from Pharma during their time in Congress.\nRice\u2019s betrayal may come as a surprise to her constituents because Rice campaigned for years on taking on Pharma\u2019s greed. And that\u2019s why Rice is the perfect example of everything wrong with status quo corporate politicians.\nRice claimed to support the lowering of prescription drugs. In an October 2020 campaign ad, Rice promised to \u201calways put the health and safety of Long Island first.\u201d\nNot to mention, an overwhelming 90 percent of Rice\u2019s constituents support giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices. It\u2019s hard to find a policy more popular with voters across the spectrum than taking on Pharma greed and lowering drug prices.\nBut when given the chance to make good on that promise, and represent the interests of 90% of her constituents, Rice still sided with Pharma and betrayed the people she works for.\nBut that\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re going to continue to fight for\u2014and win\u2014lower drug prices. We\u2019re going to win because the American people\u2014and the vast majority of the Democratic caucus and President Biden\u2014are on our side. We have the people, and we also have some big guns on our side spending money, AARP just dropped $4 million on an ad buy pushing for Medicare negotiation.\nThat is why carrying water for Pharma is not only a moral failure, it is also a political failure. Any politician who puts Pharma profits before the needs of their constituents will lose their jobs. And they will deserve it.\nPharma shills simply aren\u2019t fit to represent the people of their districts.\n Alex Lawson\nAlex Lawson is the Executive Director of Social Security Works, the convening organization of the Strengthen Social Security Coalition \u2014 a coalition made up of over 340 national and state organizations representing over 50 million Americans.\n Alexandra Rojas\nAlexandra Rojas is the executive director of Justice Democrats, the grassroots organization that recruited Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to run for Congress.\n"

                                "description": " Jessica Corbett\nAdvocates of addressing the root causes of the global climate emergency on Friday called the United States and European Union's new pledge to reduce methane emissions at least 30% by 2030 a step in the right direction but still lacking in both necessary ambition and specifics.\n\"Instead of merely pledging to do better, governments around the world must put an end to the drilling and fracking that is fueling the climate emergency.\"\u2014Wenonah Hauter, Food & Water Watch\n\"While it is encouraging to see governments' pledge to take serious action, the emissions target should be much stronger,\" said Food & Water Watch executive director Wenonah Hauter in a statement. \"We know that more aggressive cuts in methane are well within reach over the next decade, and are necessary in order to deal with the climate crisis.\"\nMeaningful climate action, including any methane reduction plans, \"must be rooted in a rapid shift away from fossil fuels,\" Hauter argued. \"The Biden administration can and must stop all new fossil fuel projects, including an end to dirty energy exploitation of our public lands.\"\n\"We have known for years that the fracking boom\u2014cheered on by so many political leaders\u2014is creating an increase in methane emissions, water contamination, and air pollution,\" she added. \"Instead of merely pledging to do better, governments around the world must put an end to the drilling and fracking that is fueling the climate emergency.\"\nHauter also highlighted concerns about gauging progress, given that bodies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \"have continually underestimated methane emissions,\" and emphasized that such targets should not include a \"so-called solution\" like factory farm biogas, explaining that \"these schemes seek to entrench harmful industrial agriculture practices, or to even encourage their expansion under the guise of climate action.\"\nShefali Sharma, director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) European office, echoed Hauter's warning about such pratices, saying in a statement that \"techno-fixes such as new feed additives and factory farm gas (or biogas digesters) are Band-Aids on a broken system of rising animal numbers, more methane, and air, land, and water pollution.\"\n\"The E.U. has missed a major opportunity in its recently finalized Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) revision to tackle methane,\" Sharma added. \"It should ensure that its climate package and methane strategy don\u2019t make the same mistake. These policies must help European agriculture transition to agroecological practices rather than incentivizing industrial systems.\"\nMultiple analyses this month have detailed industrial agriculture's contributions to global heating, particularly due to methane, which is up to 87 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. IATP is urging all countries to \"begin to appropriately regulate livestock emissions and redirect public funds to support farmers in a just transition towards biodiverse, agroecological systems.\"\nBen Lilliston, IATP's director of rural strategies and climate change, said his group and other allies defending family farmers and the environment are calling on the Biden administration to tackle factory farm emissions by enforcing the Clean Air Act.\n\"Real action on methane,\" Lilliston said, \"must include a transition away from factory farms toward less emitting, agroecological systems.\"\nU.S. President Joe Biden formally unveiled the methane goal\u2014reported by Reuters earlier this week\u2014during a Friday meeting with leaders of other major economies, a follow-up to his April climate summit. Biden said the effort to cut methane emissions 30% this decade, relative to 2020, \"will not only rapidly reduce the rate of global warming, but it will also produce a very valuable side benefit, like improving public health and agricultural output.\"\nThe Biden administration\u2014which in April announced its aim to halve overall U.S. emissions by 2030\u2014has faced mounting pressure to specifically address methane since its impact on the planet was flagged in the latest United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. Earthworks policy director Lauren Pagel last month urged the U.S. president to \"cut oil and gas methane pollution 65% by 2025.\"\nRepeating that call Friday, Pagel said that the new pledge \"marks the first international government commitment specific to reducing methane climate pollution, but words are not enough. President Biden has an immediate opportunity to show he means what he says by directing the EPA to issue the strongest rules possible under the Clean Air Act to cut methane pollution from oil and gas production.\"\nKelly Sheehan Martin, senior director of energy campaigns at the Sierra Club, said Friday that \"Biden must commit to even stronger methane reduction targets, stop subsidizing fossil fuels, and make clean, renewable energy available to all of our families and communities, especially those already overburdened by harmful pollution.\"\nBiden's confirmation of the new goal came as another U.N. report\u2014released Friday in anticipation of COP 26, a global climate summit that kicks off October 31\u2014reiterated the necessity of all nations ramping up efforts to cut planet-heating pollution. The analysis of countries' Paris agreement pledges projects a 16% increase in global emissions for 2030, compared to 2010, and warns that the world's average temperature could rise 2.7\u00b0C by the end of the century, far beyond the 1.5\u00b0C target.\nDuring the Friday meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres reportedly warned world leaders that \"the world is on a catastrophic pathway\" to 2.7\u00b0C and \"we need a 45% cut in emissions by 2030 to reach carbon neutrality by mid-century.\" Those comments came day just a day after Guterres wrote in the foreword of yet another U.N. climate report that \"unless there are immediate, rapid, and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C will be impossible.\"\n"

                                "description": " Joseph Gerson\nIn the dangerous Trump era, the Pentagon pronounced that \"There is no higher priority for national defense\" than to \"replace [the country's] strategic nuclear triad and sustain the warheads it carries.\" The estimated cost for upgrading the entire U.S. nuclear arsenal and replacing all its nuclear warhead delivery systems\u2014intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarines capable of launching ballistic missiles, and long-range bombers\u2014was $1.7 billion. Trump's Nuclear Posture Review, the guidelines for nuclear war fighting, and maintenance and acquisition of the weapons required for genocidal or omnicidal war, reaffirmed the country's first-strike nuclear war fighting doctrine, and it increased U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons. This included their possible use in response to cyber and other high-tech attacks on U.S. infrastructure.\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus has called out the Biden administration for failing to propose a nuclear weapons spending that \"does not reflect your longstanding efforts to reduce our reliance on nuclear weapons.\"\nAs we now know from Bob Woodward's new book Peril General Milley, others in Pentagon leadership, and their Chinese counterparts thought it imperative to act secretly to prevent Trump from sparking a nuclear war on the eve of the 2020 presidential election and within days of the failed January 6 coup attempt.\u00a0\nTragically, despite widespread high hopes for change, in the existential realm of potentially omnicidal nuclear war preparations, the Biden administration has signaled more continuity than change. True, it acted quickly to extend the New START Treaty with Russia, which limits each side to 1,550 strategic nuclear weapons\u2014enough to inflict the planet with nuclear winter. It is also engaged in exploratory talks with Moscow over establishing \"strategic stability\" between the two nuclear powers. While these talks are important, as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs,\u00a0 General Hyten, recently told a Brookings Institute audience, China\u2014not Russia is the \"pacing military threat\" that now drives U.S. military planning.\nThe sad and dangerous truth is that the nuclear weapons budget President Biden submitted to Congress differs little from Trump's nuclear weapons \"modernization\" commitments. Despite Biden's election year and earlier statements that the \"sole use\" of nuclear weapons that he could imagine was in response to a nuclear attack against the United States, the budget he submitted to Congress includes funding to replace the country's entire arsenal of first-strike\u2014use them or lose them\u2014ground based ICBMs. So too the budget Congress will be voting on includes funding to produce 80 plutonium pits (the fissile core of a nuclear warhead) per year\u2014each one of which with the destructive capability to devastate cities as large as Shanghai, Karachi and Moscow. Biden and his Pentagon also expect to win funding for the extremely destabilizing \"more usable\" tactical (roughly Hiroshima sized) B-61-12 bound for Europe, the nuclear air-launched cruise Long Range Standoff Weapon, and new warheads for submarine launched missiles, all designed to hold China hostage to a U.S. first-strike attack.\u00a0\nWhat is driving China's anticipated increase in the size of its nuclear arsenal and fears that it might abandon its no first use doctrine? The answer is those standoff cruise missiles and U.S. missile defenses that are being deployed along China's periphery that Chinese officials and analysts fear could make first-strike nuclear war fighting attractive to U.S. leaders. We had a glimpse of this possibility with the recent revelations that General Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, then CIA Director Haskell, Speaker Pelosi and Chinese military leaders all feared the possibility of President Trump sparking a nuclear war with China in the run up to last November's presidential election and in the immediate aftermath of the failed January 6 coup attempt. But even with a considerably more rational U.S. Commander in Chief, the very real danger remains that an incident or accident resulting from the two powers' confrontational and provocative military operations in the South or East China Seas, or near Taiwan could escalate beyond political control.\u00a0\u00a0\nDays prior to the Congressional budget debate and on the eve of the launching of the Biden administration's Nuclear Posture Review, the Defense Intelligence Agency stoked elite panic with the release of photographs which convincingly demonstrate that Beijing has initiated construction of 250 missile silos for Chinese land-based strategic intercontinental nuclear missiles.\u00a0\nYet, former lead U.S. arms control negotiator and Deputy NATO Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller warns that the silo holes being dug in northern China are a simply a \"great distraction\".\u00a0 As an arms controller, he is committed to nuclear deterrence and strategic stability and unwilling to press for what Noam Chomsky calls the \"obvious solution\" to the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons: \"getting rid of them.\"\u00a0 She is willing to concede that China's nuclear buildup is designed to reinforce its \"second strike deterrence posture\", which is threatened by U.S. nuclear and missile defense forces. Rather than panicking and wasting limited U.S. resources, she urges policymakers to remember that even if China quadruples the size of its nuclear arsenal by placing an ICBM armed with multiple warheads in each of those silos, it will still have fewer nuclear weapons than the United States or Russia. She urges lawmakers to focus on economic and technological competition and not to be panicked into funding the Pentagon's wish list of Strangelovian nuclear weapons.\nAt the policy making level there are four theaters of political struggle: 1) Congress and its debates over Biden's $634 ten-year nuclear weapons funding proposal and No First Use legislation; 2) the Biden administration's Nuclear Posture Review; 3) January's Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference at the U.N., and 4) the March 2022 governmental First Meeting of States Parties of the Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) in Geneva.\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus has called out the Biden administration for failing to propose a nuclear weapons spending that \"does not reflect your longstanding efforts to reduce our reliance on nuclear weapons.\" They oppose funding for new submarine launched nuclear warheads, to maintain the B83 gravity bombs with an explosive yield of up to 100 times the Hiroshima A-bomb, and for the Long-Range Standoff Weapon described above. And, while not calling for the total elimination of first-strike land-based ICBMs, they oppose funding for the creation of a new generation of these omnicidal weapons. They also urge that the Biden Nuclear Posture Review, which will be conducted with little public or Congressional input by the Pentagon and senior administration \"national security\" officials, mandate reduction of the nation's reliance on nuclear weapons.\u00a0\nIn addition to the Congressional budget fight, the Markey-Lieu No First Use bill and the Warren-Smith Sole Use bill are seen as means to press administration and its Nuclear Posture Review to adopt a No First Use doctrine. While Congressional adoption of these bills is\u00a0 a remote possibility at best, by holding hearings and adding co-sponsors to the legislation with the help of grassroots activists, they can raise the visibility of calls for No First Use.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat said, given the Biden administration's commitment to reasserting U.S. global leadership and dominance, from NATO to the new QUAD alliance in the Indo-Pacific, and fears that a U.S. No First Use doctrine would be politically exploited as an invitation for China to attack Taiwan, prospects for a Nuclear Posture Review that meaningfully reduces U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons are limited.\nInternationally, pressure for nuclear weapons abolition will manifest itself at the NPT Review Conference and TPNW First Meeting early in the new year. With the world's nuclear powers upgrading, and in many cases expanding,\u00a0 their nuclear arsenals, there is little hope that progress will be made to fulfill the nuclear powers' Article VI Treaty commitment to engaging in good faith negotiations for the complete elimination of their nuclear arsenals. And, with the Biden administration's embrace of Israel's new right-wing (and racist) government, it is unlikely that it will voice support for or take action to implement Washington's earlier NPT commitment to co-convene an international conference for the creation of a Middle East Nuclear and WMD-Free Zone.\u00a0\u00a0\nDim as prospects are for a successful NPT Review, it remains important for activists and international civil society to press as hard as we can for the full implementation of this seminally important treaty. Silence, being consent, would leave the nuclear powers with an open field.\nWhile Geneva is far away and few U.S. nuclear abolitionists will be able to make our ways there, spirits and hopes will be high when diplomats from many of the world's non-nuclear nations, ICAN (International Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons\u2014recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize) and other abolition advocates convene to celebrate the entry into force of the Treaty, make plans to win additional Treaty signatories and ratifications, and explore ways to fulfill Article 12 of the Treaty, which requires them to press nuclear power to \"sign, ratify and accept\"\u00a0 the treaty which was negotiated to move toward a nuclear weapons free world.\nBeing realistic, we must recognize that even if the Congressional Progressive Caucus' campaign to cut the military budget by 10% succeeds (an effort we should support), the Biden administration, the Pentagon, and the U.S. military-industrial complex are driving the existential threat of nuclear annihilation. Can we stop them? Noam Chomsky again seems to have the answer: \"Your speculation is as good as mine. The only thing that we can do is hope it is true and put all our efforts together to make it true.\"\n Joseph Gerson\nJoseph Gerson is President of the Campaign for Peace, Disarmaent and Common Security, Co-founder of the Committee for a SANE U.S. China Policy and Vice President of the International Peace Bureau. His books include Empire and the Bomb, and With Hiroshima Eyes.\n"

In fact, global warming and extreme weather events are already threatening the poorest and most vulnerable people on the continent. The 6th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released 9 August 2021, exposed the fact that global warming has been more rapid in Africa than the rest of the world. This warming\u00a0is already having devastating impacts for people, their livelihoods, and ecosystems. It is being\u00a0driven by a greedy energy system that is based on extracting and burning fossil fuels. It is an energy system that disrespects and destroys all life on earth.\u00a0The time to move away from harmful fossil fuels towards a transformed energy system that is clean, renewable, democratic, and actually serves its peoples, has never been more urgent.\nThe report identifies three funding sources that would not only fund the just transition but also address global income inequality and injustice: public finance from the global North, ending tax dodging, and dropping the debt.\nFriends of the Earth Africa, a collective of sovereign organizations working with grassroots communities on environmental and rights-based struggles in the African region, released \u2018A Just Recovery Renewable Energy Plan for Africa\u2019 on 1 September 2021.\u00a0The report, which is based on the research and modeling of renowned academic Dr. Sven Teske, shows that it is technically and financially feasible to achieve a 100% renewable energy goal for Africa by the year 2050.\u00a0\nIt shows the way to power Africa with renewable energy while also trying to stem the climate crisis, supporting employment, gender justice, reducing inequality, and pushing for a just recovery.\nSo how can Africa achieve this energy system transformation?\nAfrica needs approximately $130 billion a year between now and 2050 as investment towards achieving the 100% renewable energy goal. The report identifies three funding sources that would not only fund the just transition but also address global income inequality and injustice: public finance from the global North, ending tax dodging, and dropping the debt.\nThe one thing that stands in the way of achieving this is lack of political commitment from states on the continent but also from the global North.\nThis plan not only calls for urgent action, but provides a clear pathway\u00a0to get the funding and achieve an 100% renewable energy transition. Friends of the Earth Africa, along with 50 organizations across Africa, have signed a political statement demanding that our governments support and show their commitment to act on building renewable energy on our continent.\u00a0\nIt is time for African governments and public and private financial institutions to end their interest and investment in dirty energy in Africa and open the doors further for democratized, low-cost renewable energy accessible to all including women, youth, local communities and indigenous peoples.\nSee the key elements of our political statement below.\nThe Just Recovery Energy Plan is for a 100% renewable energy independent Africa.\u00a0\nWe commit to the Just Recovery Renewable Energy Plan for 100% Renewable Energy independent Africa. This plan is needed to tackle the twin crises of climate change and Covid-19.\nAfrica is suffering from the impacts of climate change and Covid-19.\nAfrica is facing multiple inter-related crises. The continent of Africa is vulnerable because it is so exposed to climate change impacts. Our people are still reeling from the devastating impacts of cyclones Idai (2019), Kenneth (2019) and Eloise (2021) that caused extensive flood damage and deaths in Southern Africa. The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the suffering of Africa\u2019s people and exposed the unequal, unjust, and exploitative policies which are a legacy of the colonial and post-colonial systems.\u00a0\nThe level of energy poverty in Africa is unacceptable.\u00a0\nThree-quarters of those without access to electricity now live in sub-Saharan Africa, a share that has risen over recent years. The majority of all Africans do not have clean energy sources for cooking. The number of deaths from respiratory infections is enormous and avoidable. The economic effects of Covid-19 increased the numbers of people who could not access electricity and who went into energy poverty. Africa's vast natural resources have been exploited for the benefits of others through transnational corporations and have left behind the majority of Africa\u2019s peoples.\u00a0\nWe demand clean and affordable energy for hundreds of millions of Africans currently living in energy poverty. \nThis means a need for over 300GW of new renewable energy by 2030, as agreed by the African Union, and over 2000GW by 2050. The continent surpasses all other regions in having the most potential for renewable energy. We need to dismantle the existing dirty energy systems in order to leapfrog Africa to 100% renewable energy for all by 2050.\nThis plan is supported by movements and civil society across Africa and has been modeled by renowned scientists and economists.\nIt is technically and financially feasible, with an annual investment requirement of around US$130 billion per year. We know that this plan can easily be financed through stopping illicit financial flows, providing public climate finance, and the cancellation of Africa\u2019s debt.\nWe support the creation of 7 million well-paid jobs in solar, wind, and clean people powered renewable energy through addressing climate change to build a just recovery for our peoples across Africa.\nWe support renewable energy jobs that respect worker\u2019s rights and oppose discrimination on the basis of gender or any other forms of discrimination.\nWe call on the African Union, SADC, ECOWAS and African governments to adopt and develop Just Recovery plans at the regional and national level to ensure this energy transformation. \nWe demand a deep yet fast transformation of the energy system to enable people to choose and decide on democratic energy systems that work for communities. We cannot wait any more. We demand our governments remove all barriers for achieving the goal of 100% renewable energy for all.\nWe insist on a ban for any new fossil fuel development, as recently called for by the International Energy Agency and an acceleration in retiring existing ones as they are replaced by clean and affordable energy systems.\nThis must include addressing the environmental and social problems created by fossil fuel extraction to date. We need to deploy peoples-centered solutions. We demand to be consulted and to be part of the decisions for the future energy systems.\nWe demand that our governments take effective measures to prevent the corporate capture of our democracies, including by supporting the ongoing process towards a UN binding treaty on transnational corporations and human rights; and by pulling out from any free trade agreement or investment treaty that allows corporations to obstruct the transition to a clean energy system.\nA Just Recovery Renewable Energy Plan for a 100% renewable energy independent Africa is possible.\nThe finance exists and must be paid by those who caused the climate crisis in the first place. We demand a release of the pledged climate funds by the developed world. A just recovery energy plan for renewable energy Africa is our choice and our right.\u00a0\n Dipti Bhatnagar\nDipti Bhatnagar coordinates Friends of the Earth International's climate justice and energy programme.

                                "description": " Robert Jensen\nA version of this essay was presented to an online Diversity & Inclusion gathering on August 12, 2021\nAlthough the rather inelegant term \"allyship\" had not yet become part of the social-justice lexicon, I first bumped into the complexity of being an ally in 1988 when I belatedly started to take feminism seriously.\nI was following a feminist anti-pornography group that challenged men's use and abuse of women in the sexual-exploitation industries. That is the term I use for pornography, prostitution, massage parlors, escort services\u2014all the ways that men routinely buy and sell objectified female bodies for sexual pleasure.\nChallenging patriarchy gives us a shot at being fully human. Instead of striving to \"be a man,\" we can struggle to be human.\nThe organization was founded and led by women but had one key male volunteer who helped to run the office. After I had hung around long enough to demonstrate that I was serious about being part of the effort,  Jim Koplin took me aside for a talk about the role of men. \"If you want to be part of this because you want to save women, we don't want you,\" he said.\nI was confused. Wasn't the point of critiquing men's sexual exploitation of women to help women? Yes, Jim said, but too many men who get involved in such work see themselves as the proverbial knight in shining armor, charging in to save women. They usually turn out not to be trustworthy because they are in it for their egos\u2014not to challenge patriarchal masculinity but to play the hero. \"You have to be in it for yourself,\" he said, \"but not to prove how special you are.\"\n\"You have to be here to save your own life,\" Jim told me.\nWe are allies to women in this project, he said, but we have to see how important challenging patriarchy is for ourselves. That's not because men face the same threats as women, of course, but because challenging patriarchy gives us a shot at being fully human. Instead of striving to \"be a man,\" we can struggle to be human.\nThat is central to my white male perspective on being an ally to women and people of color. Part of my motivation is self-interest, my desire to improve my own life. Why is this crucial in the struggle to create a decent society?\nJustice and Self-interest\nThere are compelling moral reasons we all should contribute to movements fighting sexism and racism. Call that the argument from justice, rooted in our moral principles. We all have core principles we endorse, at least in theory, and a lot of us would include on that list (1) the inherent dignity of all people, (2) the importance of solidarity for healthy community life, and (3) the need for a level of equality that makes dignity and solidarity possible. If we take our own principles seriously\u2014not values imposed on us, but values that we claim to embrace\u2014then we should support movements for racial and sex/gender justice because it is the right thing to do, no matter what our identity or status in existing systems.\nBut moral principles alone are not always sufficient motivation. Sometimes people believe it is in their self-interest to maintain unjust systems that give them unearned power and privilege, for at least two reasons: a desire for status and the quest for wealth. The threat of being cast out of the dominant social group can get in the way of doing the right thing. The threat of losing material comforts can get in the way, too. Those are not the only goals that drive us\u2014human nature is notoriously complex and malleable\u2014but most people want to be accepted and want to be comfortable.\nBecause none of us is an angel or a saint, we have to not only make an argument from justice but an argument from self-interest that can overcome those impediments. Resisting white supremacy and patriarchy is in the self-interest of white people and men, if we can see beyond status and wealth. Yes, if the racial and sex/gender systems dissolved, those who look like me would lose the unearned advantages we have in a racist and sexist society. But it is worth giving up those short-term benefits to gain that shot at being more fully human.\nBy that I do not mean that people like me are subhuman, of course. I am not arguing that all white people and men are active agents of evil who have abandoned their humanity. But the irrational claims of white supremacy and patriarchy\u2014the idea that those who look like me deserve to be on top\u2014keep us from living as fully and deeply as possible. Those irrational claims corrupt relationships with people who could add fullness and depth to our lives.\nI realize this is more a statement of faith than a factual claim, more a testimony than a presentation of data. But that is my experience and one shared by many others: We cannot be committed to irrational ideas\u2014to illusions about who we are\u2014and expect to live truly satisfying emotional and spiritual lives.\nIt can be difficult to persuade affluent white men of this. It can be even more difficult to persuade poor or working-class white men, those who struggle to get by day-to-day and often find this kind of argument condescending or irrelevant. That is why the case also has to be made for solidarity across racial and sex/gender lines in challenging the unjust distribution of wealth in a capitalist economy. We have to overcome the divide-and-conquer strategy that has been so successful at keeping so many people\u2014white and non-white, men and women\u2014poor or on the edge of poverty.\nI have found that my life improved once I began to learn about the history and contemporary practice of white supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism.\nPut bluntly: White men, at all levels of \"success,\" should stop looking for scapegoats, for easy targets to avoid accountability. We should realize we need to save our own lives.\nLet me repeat: I am not suggesting a false equivalency, that white supremacy and patriarchy in a capitalist society are equally damaging to everyone. That would be absurd. Women and people of color face constant hassles and targeted harassment that can be life-threatening. They live with the constant threat of violence and discrimination, subtle and overt. They never know when a routine interaction might morph into a threat because of sexism or racism. It would be grotesque to say that life is just as tough for white people and men as for people of color and women. I am not saying that.\nBut being on top\u2014and believing that is the way the world should be arranged\u2014diverts us from the knowledge we need to understand society, damages our capacity for connections with other people, and distracts us from understanding the sources of our own pain. To put it bluntly: Being on top\u2014and believing that is the way the world should be arranged\u2014deforms us.\nIf that is too abstract, I will speak personally. I will use \"I\" statements, to borrow a guideline from therapy talk.\nI have found that my life improved once I began to learn about the history and contemporary practice of white supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism. That knowledge led me to yearn for something more than being a white guy. I saw the negative effects of those systems not just on women and people of color but on me. The argument from justice that I\u00a0already understood, but rarely acted from, was bolstered by a new argument from self-interest, the pursuit of a more fully human self.\nThis long introduction explains how I view the term \"ally,\" a word I have never used to describe myself. A white man could try to be helpful to women and people of color without seeing his own stake in the issues. But in my experience, the \"I'm here to help\" approach leads people like me to keep our distance emotionally, to be supportive without being engaged. As my friend Jim suggested, it is difficult to trust white men who are hedging their bets. It is better, I think, to understand movements for sex/gender and racial justice as essential to our own flourishing. White guys do not have the same stake in those movements as women and people of color, but we have a stake that matters. Although it may seem hyperbolic, Jim was right: I am in this to save my own life.\nStrategy Is Not Simple\nWhat does this mean in practice? This approach does not magically make it easy for a white guy to know what to do in specific situations. It is almost never easy. Here are some ways we struggle to \"get it right.\"\nIt is now a clich\u00e9 that people like me should accept the leadership of women and people of color. That is fine, but not all women agree about how best to challenge patriarchy. In fact, some conservative women do not want to challenge institutionalized male dominance but, instead, strive to carve out a  protected space within patriarchy. Some feminist women want to improve the status of women without addressing other systems of power. Not all feminist women who have a more consistently radical agenda share the same analysis, which can lead to polar opposite conclusions. The intra-feminist debate about the ideology of the transgender movement is a good example; there is not even a consensus on the boundaries of the category \"woman.\"\nSimilarly, people of color obviously are not a monolithic group. People from different non-white racial/ethnic groups can have conflicting agendas that sometimes produce tension. People within the same groups do not always agree on strategy. Ibram X. Kendi (a radical black African-American Studies professor),  Adolph Reed (a black political scientist who has critiqued identity politics from the left), and Thomas Sowell (a conservative black economist) have quite different proposals for combating white supremacy. In local organizing groups aimed at racial justice, I have seen significant disagreements etween like-minded activists.\nSo, whose leadership am I to follow? This is not an evasion of responsibility or accountability but, rather, a recognition that we have to make choices that cannot be resolved with a slogan.\nI ran into this early in my political life in that group that offered a feminist critique of pornography. There were feminists on the other side of the issue and hence no single feminist viewpoint that I could embrace. I had to decide which analysis was most compelling and follow the leadership of those feminist women, which meant I would be in conflict with other feminists. Since the late 1980s when I became active,  the feminist anti-pornography position has lost ground and been marginalized in many feminist groups and women's studies programs, which means I am often criticized by pro-pornography feminist women. But to renounce that anti-pornography critique would be to abandon the feminist women who have worked so hard for so long to challenge men's exploitation of women. Since the evidence to support the anti-pornography position is more compelling than ever,  I continue to support that political project. I am rejecting the leadership of some women in favor of the leadership of others. There is no way to avoid such choices.\nSimple Rules for Strategizing\nIt is complicated, but this much is obvious: My job is not to tell women or people of color what they should think, what they should want, or how they should go about trying to get it. There are women and people of color who believe things I do not believe, articulate goals I do not share, and propose strategies I think will fail. That is hardly surprising. Given the individual variation in the human species, it would be remarkable if that were not the case.\nSo, I focus on talking to men and white people. When I am speaking to a group about feminism, I am there primarily to challenge men. My book The End of Patriarchy\u00a0is subtitled\u00a0Radical Feminism for Men. When I am speaking about racial justice, my target audience is white. My book on the subject,  The Heart of Whiteness, argues that white people\u2014especially white liberals who think they have transcended white supremacy\u2014should be Confronting Race, Racism and White Privilege.\nBut that raises another thorny question: Given all the excellent books by women and people of color, why am I writing at all? Why am I not simply recommending other people's work to men and white people?\nThere are two answers to this question. One is that women and people of color I have worked with have encouraged me to speak and write because men and white people sometimes are more willing to listen to someone who looks like me. We all recognize the irony: I am trading on the presumed authority that white supremacy and patriarchy give me, in order to argue for the end of white supremacy and patriarchy.\nSecond, I try to make it clear that when I write about these subjects I am building on the work of many other writers and activists. Before doing talks on these subjects, I explain that there are no original ideas in my writing, that all I am doing is offering the insights of women and people of color, reflected through my own experience.\nThose are honest answers, but that is an incomplete story. I also write because I think I am good at it, and because I like it. I know I am building on the work of others, but I think my books offer insights that, if not wholly original to me, are of value. I think my ability to write in plain language, without academic jargon or overheated political rhetoric, makes my work effective. The same goes for my public speaking. There are valid strategic reasons for having someone who looks like me\u2014an older white guy with short hair\u2014speak on these subjects, but the truth is I like doing it. This work makes me feel good.\nSo, I readily confess that in speaking and writing, I have mixed motives. That is not really much of a confession, since it is so obviously true of everyone. One of my favorite aphorisms is \"I've never met a motive that wasn't mixed.\" (I first heard that from a friend who said he got it from an Episcopal priest, and then I later saw it attributed to an unnamed Jesuit scholar. My guess is there is some version of that insight in every tradition.) In all my years of political organizing and intellectual life, I have yet to meet an angel or a saint. We do things for complex reasons involving our sense of justice and our own desires, which we are not always consciously aware of.\nSo, back to the real-world questions that we white guy allies have to face: When should we speak up, and when should we be quiet and listen? It is hard to learn while you are talking, but we also have an obligation to speak out against injustice. When should we take the lead and when should we step back? Again, there are no one-size-fits-all rules to guide us. We have to deal with context, complexity, and uncertainty.\nConsider two different strategies when white people and men want to help achieve a policy change that can advance racial or sex/gender justice in an organization. One strategy would be for the women or people of color to present a proposal, with folks like me waiting to see what kind of support they need as the discussion goes forward. If other white guys resist, there might be a moment in which I speak forcefully to counter that resistant. I might hold my presumed authority in reserve, to be used only if needed.\nA different strategy would be for me to speak first, perhaps offering the most radical proposal possible, knowing the organization will not accept it, but this can create space for the women or people of color to follow with a more moderate proposal that can succeed. I have called this the tactic of being  \"the craziest person in the room\" to push the limits of what is possible.\nWhich is the best approach? That will depend on the situation, and it is not always easy to know. The only clear rule is that I should not decide which strategy to pursue independently. The folks trying to make change should get together ahead of time to determine the most effective path. In those discussions, I might feel strongly about the best course of action, but the final decision has to come from the group. It is not my call.\nFacing White Guy Fears\nThat suggests my final observation about being an ally: We have to be willing to give up control, and that can be hard for anyone, especially white guys. Again, let me use \"I\" statements: I find it hard to give up control. I am not talking about the common desire most of us have to feel in control of our own destiny but rather control of things around us. Here I want to continue in a more personal vein, to try to get beyond slogans and deal with the messiness of our lives.\n\"[Women] do not want to do the work of helping you to believe in your humanity. We cannot do it anymore. We have always tried. We have been repaid with systematic exploitation and systematic abuse. You are going to have to do this yourselves from now on and you know it.\"\u2014Andrea Dworkin\nI grew up in a family defined by trauma. As a child, I had no control over the abuse I endured. As I got older, I did what lots of traumatized kids do: I unconsciously tried to limit my vulnerability to others by striving to always be in control. I could not make that work, as evidenced by a succession of failed relationships, but my go-to strategy was to stay in control, tightly. As I got older and engaged these critical movements, especially feminism, I started to step back from that obsession for control. That has not been easy, but it has been rewarding.\nPeople in control typically do not like to relinquish control. And since white guys are disproportionately in positions that give us control, we often resist letting go of that control and have to struggle to open up possibilities for new kinds of interactions and connections. Think of the white people and the men you know\u2014or if you are white or male, think about your own experience. Do they fit this pattern? Do I fit this pattern? Do we try to control political situations around race and sex, even when we say we are trying to be allies?\nI know other white guys who have childhood experiences like mine. In a culture rooted in racial and sexual hierarchies\u2014in a world in which so many relationships are defined by a domination/subordination dynamic\u2014the widespread neglect and abuse of children is hardly surprising. Rather than stepping back from that desire to control self and others, some of those white guys will try to tighten their grip. In my experience, they tend not to be happy people or reliable allies.\nIt is easy to critique and even condemn such white guys. Critique is always warranted. Sometimes condemnation might be appropriate. I am not making excuses for us white guys when we mess up. But I am suggesting we try to understand why it happens so often. I identified a desire for status and material comfort as two reasons we might hold on tightly to unearned power and privilege. Here is another reason: fear.\nIt may seem ludicrous to suggest that white men are afraid, but is it so hard to imagine? I am not suggesting every white man shares my experience of childhood trauma or adopts my coping mechanisms growing up. I am speaking only for myself: The deeper motivation for my desire to stay in control has been a fear that runs deeply in me, that goes back to my earliest days. That is not an excuse for times I behaved badly. It is part of my struggle to understand why I have behaved badly, to maximize the potential for change.\nWhat is true about me is not true about every white man. But it does suggest that we white men should ask each other: What are you most afraid of? Are you afraid you are not man enough? Tough enough? Successful enough? Are you afraid you cannot live up to the deformed image of white men that we were raised with?\nMy final words on overcoming this fear come from the two writers who were most central in my education, Andrea Dworkin and James Baldwin. Starting in essays in the early 1970s, Dworkin wrote not only for women but offered men help in understanding ourselves. Starting in essays in the early 1960s, Baldwin wrote not only for black people but offered white people help in understanding ourselves.\nFirst,  Dworkin's loving challenge to men:\n\"[Women] do not want to do the work of helping you to believe in your humanity. We cannot do it anymore. We have always tried. We have been repaid with systematic exploitation and systematic abuse. You are going to have to do this yourselves from now on and you know it.\"\nSecond,  Baldwin's insight into fear:\n\"I think the inability to love is the central problem, because the inability masks a certain terror, and that terror is the terror of being touched. And, if you can't be touched, you can't be changed. And, if you can't be changed, you can't be alive.\"\nI am grateful to writers like Dworkin and Baldwin for what they taught me. But I do not expect women or people of color to help men or white people deal with this. I expect us to deal with it ourselves. Because it is the right thing to do. Because it is in our own self-interest.\nBack to speaking personally, only for myself: Because it is the right thing for me to do. Because it is in my self-interest. Because I want to love and be loved. Because I want to touch and be touched. Because I want to be changed and change others. Because I want to be alive.\n Robert Jensen\nRobert Jensen, an emeritus professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, collaborates with Ecosphere Studies at The Land Institute.

                                "description": " Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II,\u00a0 Tope Folarin\nThe day after President Biden\u2019s speech defending the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, a new poll indicated a significant majority of people in the U.S. supported the move. More than two-thirds agreed the U.S. had failed to achieve its goals in Afghanistan. That\u2019s a far cry from the 88 percent who supported the war when it was launched in October 2001.\u00a0\nSpending more on the U.S. military budget than the next 10 countries combined represents a huge part of the reason we have to struggle so hard to fund crucial social needs\u2014from healthcare to climate to education and more.\nIn part, this is a movement victory.\u00a0\nMovements against the war on terror emerged within days of the 9/11 attacks, even before the first U.S. bombers assaulted Kabul. This rising anti-war drumbeat played a major part in pulling public opinion away from support for Washington\u2019s \u201cforever wars.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a given that Biden would pull out of Afghanistan\u2014other presidents have promised to do so and then failed. This time, there is no question that public opposition to the war was critical to Biden\u2019s decision.\u00a0\nThat shift also shows that people across the U.S. have learned some harsh realities that anti-war activists mobilized around for years.\nAmericans now agree there is no military solution to terrorism. They recognize that governments and military forces that are created and imposed by occupying armies will never be, and never be seen as, fighting for the people or the country, but only as fighting for an unwelcome foreign government. They\u2019ve come to accept that women\u2019s rights and democracy can\u2019t be won and that terrorism can\u2019t be defeated, by acts of war.\u00a0\nAnd most of all we\u2019ve all learned that the costs of war\u2014human, moral, and economic\u2014are simply too high.\u00a0\nPresident Biden was right to focus the country\u2019s attention on the staggering economic cost of the war he was ending\u2014more than $2 trillion, just for the war in Afghanistan, he reminded us. That translates to $300 million every day for two decades.\u00a0\nAnd that\u2019s just a small part of our government\u2019s staggering spending on the militarization of our society during these 20 years of the war on terror. The National Priorities Project at the Institute for Policy Studies has calculated that cost at $21 trillion. Beyond the trillions spent on the military around the world, it includes spending on militarizing police and U.S. borders, as well as domestic surveillance and repression.\u00a0\nFor a fraction of that cost we could create millions of well-paying jobs, guarantee every child access to pre-school, transform our electrical grid to clean energy, and pay for vaccines for entire populations of low-income countries\u2014all of which would have made us far safer than going to war.\nAnd then there\u2019s the human cost. According to the Costs of War Project at Brown University, the war in Afghanistan killed 170,000 Afghans. All told, 900,000 people have been killed in the post-9/11 wars overall, with the largest share in Iraq. And those are conservative estimates. Millions more have been injured and tens of millions more displaced, forced from their homes and too often from their country.\nFinally, there is the moral and political cost. Neither the war of choice in Afghanistan nor the other wars that followed should have happened. Afghanistan was about vengeance, not justice, Iraq was fought for oil and power and bases, not for non-existent weapons of mass destruction... Yet our presidents waged these wars, and our Congress funded them, year after year. Countless lives have been lost or destroyed, and our democracy has been weakened in the process.\nSo what is our moral obligation now?\u00a0\nFirst, Washington needs to stop killing people. Not only in Afghanistan but in Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and in all the places where U.S. troops, CIA operatives, and U.S. mercenaries work in the shadows and kill people. It needs to stop. We all also have a moral obligation to help the refugees and displaced peoples from these conflicts, and we owe debts of compensation and reparations to the people who remain in their war-torn countries.\nFor Afghans, the end of the U.S. war doesn\u2019t mean an end of conflict and struggle. But it does mean the end of bombing of their hospitals, the end of missile strikes on wedding parties and funerals, the end of Special Forces operatives kicking down doors and killing people in their own homes.\u00a0It means starting to reclaim their country.\nCertainly, we must challenge the regressive and misogynist acts of the Taliban and hope that the transformations of the last 20 years\u2014in the people of Afghanistan and their relationship with the rest of the world\u2014will lead to major changes. But that does not diminish our own obligations, rooted in recognition of the harm that U.S. actions have brought to so many innocent Afghans.\nNext, we have a moral obligation to challenge our nation\u2019s assumptions and priorities.\nWe have to reverse the popular assumption that having the most powerful military and the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world somehow makes us a better, \u201cexceptional\u201d country. We have to challenge the notion that maintaining more than 800 environmentally and socially destructive military bases across the globe somehow wins us friends and allies among the world\u2019s peoples.\u00a0\nAnd finally, we have to broaden the understanding that spending more on the U.S. military budget than the next 10 countries combined represents a huge part of the reason we have to struggle so hard to fund crucial social needs\u2014from healthcare to climate to education and more.\nMany Afghans, though of course not all, agree with Mahbooba Seraj, founder of the Afghan Women\u2019s Network, when she said the end of Washington\u2019s long war in Afghanistan brought her \u201can absolute sense of relief.\u201d For Afghans, the end of the U.S. war doesn\u2019t mean an end of conflict and struggle. But it does mean the end of bombing of their hospitals, the end of missile strikes on wedding parties and funerals, the end of Special Forces operatives kicking down doors and killing people in their own homes.\u00a0It means starting to reclaim their country.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, this might mean the beginning of reclaiming our country, too\u2014for people, for the planet, for jobs, for healthcare, for education, and more. For our democracy.\u00a0\nEnding the war in Afghanistan is a start, but our movements still have a lot of work left to do.\n Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II\nRev. Dr. William J.

                                "description": " Jane Braxton Little\nAt 10 a.m. on July 22nd, I interviewed a New York University professor about using autonomous robots, drones, and other unmanned devices to suppress structural and wildland fires. I sent the interview to an online transcription service, walked down the steps of my second-floor office and a block to the Greenville post office, where I mailed a check to California Fair Plan for homeowners\u2019 fire insurance. I then drove 25 miles to a dental appointment. I was lucky to make it home before burning debris closed the roads.\nThat night I became a climate refugee, evacuated from my house thanks to the Dixie Fire. Since then, it\u2019s scorched a landscape nearly the size of Delaware, destroyed 678 houses and decimated several communities in Indian Valley, where I\u2019ve been for 46 years. One of them was Greenville, California, a town founded in the Gold Rush era of the nineteenth century, where I happen to live. I never imagined myself among the 55 million people worldwide whose lives have already been upended by climate change. Maybe no one does until it happens, even though we\u2019re obviously the future for significant parts of humanity. Those of us who acknowledge the climate disaster\u2014especially those who write about it\u2014may be the last to picture ourselves fleeing the catastrophes scientists have been predicting.\nClimate change should come as no surprise to any of us, even in Greenville, one of four communities in rural Plumas County tucked into the mountains of the northern Sierra Nevada range, 230 miles northeast of San Francisco. No one would call most of us progressive. We\u2019re a social mishmash of loggers, miners, and ranchers, many of whom strongly supported Donald Trump (despite a disparate population of aging hippies living among us). We squabble over water ditches and whose insurance should cover which parade. We picked to death a solar-power project and took five years to decide on a design for a community building. The town has been in decline since I moved there nearly half a century ago, slowly sinking into its dirt foundations.\nDespite Greenville\u2019s insularity, we\u2019ve had some inkling that the world is changing around us. Old-timers talk about the winters when so much snow fell that they had to shovel from second-story windows to get out of their houses. Last winter, we got less than three feet of snow. In the 1980s, a warm March storm flooded Indian Valley with melted snow that floated stacks of newly sawn lumber away from a local sawmill into a just-created lake. We all cheered as brazen cowboys lassoed bundles of two-by-fours and hauled them off in their pickup trucks.\nIn a megadrought-ridden West, precipitation currently is half the normal amount, making it prospectively the driest year since 1894. Today, such modest clues to a changing climate seem quaint indeed in the face of the evidence now bombarding California and the rest of the West. As in recent years, this summer\u2019s fires began breaking out here far earlier than the norm. Already 647 wildfires have burned 4.9 million acres of the West, an area three times the size of Rhode Island. In California, 31 new fires started on August 30th alone\u2014and any significant rain or snow is undoubtedly still months away.\nFor me, as for the rest of us in Plumas County, the Dixie Fire delivered the reality of climate change in a raging fury that has forever changed our lives. It started July 13th in the Feather River Canyon, a 5,000-foot gorge that carries water to more than 25 million Californians through the State Water Project. Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) has built a series of power stations here that dammed the former trophy-trout stream and converted its cascading energy into electricity, generating around 15% of California\u2019s hydropower. At approximately seven o\u2019clock that Tuesday morning, a hydroelectric facility lost power at Cresta in the lower Feather River Canyon. Officials later reported a \u201chealthy green tree\u201d leaning perilously against a conductor on a pole with a fire burning on the ground near the base of that tree. By evening, that micro-blaze had exploded to 1,000 acres.\nOver the next 14 days what came to be known as the Dixie Fire whipped up one side canyon and down another, driving residents out of the town of Indian Falls and incinerating their homes. It demolished Canyon Dam at the southern end of Lake Almanor. The inhabitants of the towns of Crescent Mills, then Greenville, and soon after Taylorsville fled. Some of us returned for a night or two, only to heed the sirens blaring from our cell phones mandating another evacuation. Believe me, we left in a panic: pizza parlors with dough still rising; beauty salons with hair littering the floor; offices with phones ringing. We fled on whatever roads remained open to wherever we could find housing or friends willing to take us in.\nOn August 4th, we watched from our separate hells as a 40,000-foot cloud the color of bruised flesh collapsed over the ridge west of Greenville. It was soon hurling flaming branches and red-hot embers down the mountainside, torching trees as it roared into town. We were transfixed by horror, snatching previously unimaginable images from Facebook, chasing down Twitter links, and trying to make sense of the devastation evolving on infrared maps.\nWe were witnessing Greenville\u2019s near-obliteration. The Dixie Fire would thunder right down Main Street with its Western false fronts and tarnished Gold Rush charm. The 150-year-old warehouse converted to a museum years ago flamed up in a blaze of black-and-white photos, historic logging tools, and the genealogy of generations of the Mountain Maidu, the local Native American tribe. Fire gutted the brick-walled Masonic Lodge and the Way Station, our only local watering hole. Much of the town we had fled burned to the ground.\nHotter and Drier\nThe old-timers didn\u2019t tell us about fires like this. I witnessed nothing remotely as turbulent during a long-ago season as a fire lookout on Dyer Mountain near Lake Almanor. Even firefighters (and my husband used to be one of them) hardened by a decade of recent experience say that this fire is behaving unlike anything they were trained to confront or have ever seen. It has them bamboozled as it circles back toward landscapes it\u2019s already burned, storming through magic forests of old-growth red fir and stately stands of sugar pines, their foot-long cones just beginning to mature.\nDixie is roaring through forests transformed by a changing climate. The planet is simply hotter than it used to be. Worldwide temperatures have increased 2.04 degrees Fahrenheit since 1901. The United States has been warming even faster, adding 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit since 1970. In the Sierra Nevada, the 450-mile-long tilted block of granite that lies on California\u2019s border with Nevada, a recent study by climate scientists at UCLA suggested that temperatures could rise a phenomenal 7 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. All that heat is grilling brush and small trees practically to the point of spontaneous combustion, priming them for the smallest spark. Scientists say that the number of days when Sierra forests are likely to burn has increased by 5% since the 1970s.\nNighttime temperatures are also rising, further confounding the efforts of firefighters to control such blazes. They count on cooler air and higher humidity after dark to help them in aggressive attacks. According to researchers at the Western Regional Climate Center in Reno, California\u2019s overnight lows are now running about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above the average for the 1981-2010 period that climate scientists use as a benchmark. Robbed of their after-dark advantages, firefighters report seeing flames torching off the crowns of trees in the middle of the night, something they\u2019re not faintly used to.\nThe Sierra air is drier, too. We used to brag about our low humidity, mocking our East Coast friends dripping sweat on a 90-degree day while we basked in dry heat. Now, that\u2019s a liability. Decreasing relative humidity has helped boost the number of days each year when forests are vulnerable to wildfire. It also accelerates evaporation from leaves, brush, and even dead trees, heightening the risk of intense fires and so exacerbating the challenge for firefighters.\nThen there\u2019s the wind. Once upon a time, on hot Sierra summer days, we welcomed the breezes that stirred the air and cooled us. This summer, the least stirring of leaves instills fear. Dixie\u2019s erratic winds have, in fact, blown flames right back into previously burned areas, circling around the lines firefighters have built to try to control the fire.\nClimate change doesn\u2019t start wildfires. The vast majority are caused by human activity. But by drying out trees, chaparral, and other vegetation, it creates a warmer, more arid world, one ever more susceptible to extreme fire behavior. PG&E, which owns more than 130,000 acres of California, has reported an increase in fire vulnerability in the area it serves from 15% in 2019 to 50% by 2021.\nThe utility company has all but admitted responsibility for starting the Dixie Fire. If that proves true it would be the fourth such wildfire linked to it, a record that reeks of blatant neglect of fundamental power-line maintenance. PG&E officials have touted their routine inspections of the two power poles located where the fire started. They found nothing wrong, they reported to the California Public Utilities Commission. But the company also considers the span of power line near where the fire started to be among the top 20% of its distribution lines most likely to ignite a wildfire by tree contact. Keep in mind that the Dixie Fire started less than a mile from where PG&E\u2019s power lines started the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 85 people and burned 18,804 buildings.\nWill corporate executives be held accountable for the Dixie Fire? Will they lose any sleep over the burly backhoe operator weeping publicly about the loss of his home with its newly remodeled kitchen? Will they spare a thought for the weary family of seven wandering through Safeway wondering how, as exiles, they\u2019ll even pay for their groceries?\nClimate Refugees\nAll of us who live in the mountainous West have come to expect wildfires. We don\u2019t pack up at the first puff of smoke. During the early days after Dixie had started 50 miles down the Feather River Canyon from Greenville, I felt safe. Even when burning trees were visible from my office window as I grabbed photos and notebooks to evacuate, I still felt confident that I would return to my books and 40 years of journalism files, pieces ranging from local murders to ones on refugees from the Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster in Fukushima, Japan, and forest fires burning in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in the Ukraine.\nIt took two more days before the winds shifted, blowing flames down North Canyon toward the town, overwhelming our firefighters. Today, all that\u2019s left in Greenville\u2019s downtown commercial area is devastation. The places I knew for so long are now gone, including Hunter Hardware, the business that welcomed us when my husband and I moved to Indian Valley, two blond toddlers in tow; Sterling Sage, where I bought jewelry for my granddaughter from the town\u2019s most dapper businessman; and Village Drug, where our Plumas County supervisor took calls from constituents while dispensing medicines and school supplies. That was, in fact, Greenville\u2019s oldest building and housed the office I shared with a poet/playwright and a corporate administrator with a passion for knitting that we liked to call Fiber, Fact, and Fiction. Now, it\u2019s all ash.\nHow do you weigh the loss of such businesses against the hundreds of friends, neighbors, and acquaintances whose homes have been destroyed? Most of us waited days for some kind of confirmation about whether ours had made it or not, hanging on every word from state fire officials who described the advancing flames in twice-daily video meetings. We searched the Internet for shards of information and poured over maps with tiny red heat dots that might spell out our futures.\nI danced for joy when I learned that my house had indeed survived, along with the timber-frame barn my husband had built from our own hand-milled timber. My ebullience plummeted into mourning for the sweet recluse who lost his beloved books and the widow whose family photos were all gone. Along Main Street in the town\u2019s historic residential area, not a house remains, not even a single standing wall among brick walkways and charred garden plots.\nThose 678 homeless neighbors of ours join millions around the world fleeing cyclones, hurricanes, fires, and floods, among other weather events brought to a boil by a changing climate. Like the majority of them, the fire that forced us to leave our homes was local and, given the size of this planet, relatively small-scale. It dominated the news cycle for a week or two before being displaced (without being faintly extinguished) by those fleeing hurricane Ida in Louisiana and political refugees trying to escape Afghanistan.\nGreenville has plenty of experience with privation. As the county\u2019s least affluent town we\u2019ve rallied to keep our high school open when county officials planned to close it. We\u2019ve rallied to install sidewalks and retain a health clinic after our only hospital closed. We may disagree about everything from who should be fire chief to the value of Covid vaccinations, but bully Greenville with an outside threat and we\u2019re as one. The enemies of our enemies become our friends.\nToday, we are facing a threat like no other. How do you rebuild a community with no post office, no library, and where, in the absence of public transportation, the closest gas station is now a 50-mile round trip? Who will step forward for those too broken to restore themselves?\nGreenville and Indian Valley are now poised between devastation and possibility. Even as smoke still rises from the ashes, there are faint signs of hope. The generation that left for far-flung parts of the world has organized online donations and relief sites offering food, laptops, vehicles, and cash to the newly homeless. There are plans to expand the community garden from a concept and empty raised beds to a future bounty of vegetables, fruits, and flowers. After a century of genocide and abuse, the Mountain Maidu, the area\u2019s first residents, have energized us with their vision of land and species restoration as they assume stewardship of around 3,000 acres of their ancestral territories. Some of us want to mount the works of local artists as four-by-four posters beautifying the fences designed to protect us from the toxic waste of burned-out buildings. Others are planning to stage local musical events on the lawn of the high school that somehow miraculously survived.\nIt\u2019s a long, tough climb from incineration to inspiration for a community that\u2019s physically scattered and emotionally shattered. Many of us remain in mind-numbing limbo, still awaiting word from some anonymous official that will allow us to return to homes, if we have them. Those of us allowed back, as my husband and I have been, are halted by National Guard troops and required to show paperwork proving that we belong here. We have little prospect of Internet or landline telephone service any time soon and we no longer expect consistent electricity from PG&E.\nWhat may save us is the very reputation for defiance that has often been our undoing. We don\u2019t accept defeat easily, not even against an adversary as daunting as climate change. As long as the odds are stacked against us, the independent and ornery will respond. If the soul of a community is its resilience, Greenville will revive. Still, we\u2019re just a hint of what\u2019s to come in this country and on this planet if all of us don\u2019t change things in major ways. Remember, you could become a climate refugee, too.\u00a0\n Jane Braxton Little\nJane Braxton Little is an independent journalist who writes about science and natural resources for publications that include the Atlantic, Audubon, National Geographic, and Scientific American.

The many plans already underway for Greenville\u2019s reemergence are heartening.\nI would like to add some context to the fire emergency that California is facing. When Europeans arrived en masse in California, during the Gold Rush, the Sierra Nevada was covered by an ancient forest. These are the trees that John Muir rhapsodized about, the sugar pines, tall, straight, up to 800 years old, and twelve feet or more around at the base, with a crown of 70 feet.\nOld growth forests are impervious to wild fire. Their crowns keep out the light, and prevent undergrowth from growing. Fire does not kill those ancient trees. You can see living old trees with fire-scarred trunks in the footprint of old fires. The oldest trees survive.\nBetween about 1860 and 1960, the old growth forests of the Sierra Nevada were clear cut by loggers, who shipped billions of lumber feet all over the world. Trees grew back like weeds, 3,000 to an acre, where before the ancient trees had stood about 200 to an acre, all across the 450 miles of slopes of the mountains. The sugar pine is slow-growth straight pine; some of the best lumber in the world. We still have groves of redwood trees, because they are not good lumber, and the trees can shatter when they fall.

The U.K. is hosting this year's summit\u2014which is scheduled to start on October 31\u2014in partnership with Italy.\n\"Indigenous communities are often sacrifice zones bearing the brunt of extractive development and the effects of destructive weather events,\" the groups said. \"Our communities have long been disproportionately impacted not just by climate change, but the forces that are responsible for creating it.\"\nThe statement continued:\nThe representatives of the U.K. as the host of the UNFCCC COP 26 have previously stated they would create mechanisms to ensure the safety and participation of Indigenous peoples, as well as local and civil society from developing countries. However, the United Kingdom's actions have been deeply inadequate to assure just and effective participation of our frontline communities.\nWith strategic guidance given by our Indigenous Global South partners, should the U.K. and UNFCCC decide against postponing the COP, our organizations will still commit to attending the conference, offer interventions in support and solidarity with those who cannot attend, and elevate our frontline community demands. However, it must be reiterated; this is not a preferred arrangement.\n\"The exclusion of Indigenous peoples from the Global South would effectively silence them\u2014by failing to enhance accommodations and, those who will be most impacted by the agenda items of the COP, such as Article 6 of the Paris agreement, will be denied their guaranteed right to participation,\" the groups added. \"No equitable or just climate solutions can emerge from such an unjust process.\"\nThe Indigenous groups join more than 1,500 other organizations around the world in arguing that COP 26 should be postponed due to continuing disparities in coronavirus vaccine distribution. Less than 2% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose of vaccine, according to Our World in Data. Many of those nations have been hard-hit by the highly contagious Delta variant.\nTasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network, said earlier this month that \"looking at the current timeline for COP 26 and the logistical challenges, it is difficult to imagine fair participation from the Global South under safe conditions and it should therefore be postponed.\"\n\"The climate talks are important,\" Essop added, \"but against the current context of 'vaccine apartheid,' they simply cannot proceed by locking out the voices of those who especially need to be heard at this time.\"\n"

                                "description": " Jessica Corbett\nAt least 40 climate activists were arrested Friday at the New York City offices of JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Bank of America, organizers said, as campaigners across the United States demanded financial institutions stop supporting the destruction of the planet.\n\"We need our government leaders to take action immediately... The climate crisis is here, now.\"\u2014Christina See, XR NYC\n\"People are in denial about the mess we're in,\" said Kerith Creo of Extinction Rebellion (XR) NYC. \"We're sending a message loud and clear that the little action that politicians and greenwashing CEOs have taken so far does not begin to deal with the magnitude of this crisis.\"\nThe protest actions included delivering 150,000 petition signatures as part of the Stop the Money Pipeline (STMP) coalition's \"Deadline Glasgow: Defund Climate Chaos\" campaign to pressure banks ahead of COP 26, a United Nations summit set to start on October 31.\nDespite financial institutions' net-zero emissions by 2050 pledges, the petition highlights, \"they are providing loans, insurance, and billions in investment capital to corporations expanding the fossil fuel industry and deforesting the Amazon and other tropical forests\u2015companies that are guilty of human rights abuses and violations of Indigenous sovereignty.\"\nThe petition calls out some specific projects\u2014such as Line 3\u2014and urges banks, insurers, asset managers, and the Biden administration to \"end their support for companies engaged in climate destruction and human rights abuses\" before the two-week U.N. summit in Scotland.\nThe upcoming negotiations in Glasgow \"are the most important international climate talks since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015,\" STMP said in a statement Friday. \"It is also supposed to be 'the climate finance COP.'\"\nThe coalition continued:\nScientists say that almost 60% of oil and gas reserves and 90% of coal must remain in the ground to keep global warming below 1.5\u00b0C. This follows a groundbreaking report from the International Energy [Agency] earlier this year that stated \"there is no need for investment in new fossil fuel supply in our net-zero pathway.\" Yet, not a single Wall Street bank has committed to winding down their investments in oil and gas and all still have some exposure to coal. In fact, the largest fossil fuel financier, JPMorgan Chase, has publicly committed to funding oil and gas for years to come.\nIn New York City, climate activists set up a boat outside the office of JPMorgan Chase, urging the bank to \"stop the greenwashing,\" and draped a banner that read \"#1 Funder of Climate Death\" over the building's entrance.\nAt Bank of America's Manhattan office, \"half a dozen women blockaded the entrance and a seventh woman sat in a hammock supported by a large tripod on the sidewalk,\" according to XR. Outside Citibank's building, \"activists set up a camp on the lawn near the entrance and put up a tripod to which they locked themselves down.\"\n\"We've reached the breaking point,\" said Christina See of XR NYC. \"We need our government leaders to take action immediately. The New York City area saw over 40 deaths due to record breaking floods just a few weeks ago. The climate crisis is here, now.\"\nThe remnants of Hurricane Ida\u2014which initially made landfall in Louisiana on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina\u2014caused fatal flooding across the Northeast, sparking warnings from not only climate activists but also political leaders about what the future holds.\nWhile touring damage in New York and New Jersey, President Joe Biden said that \"we got to listen to the scientists and the economists and the national security experts. They all tell us this is code red; the nation and the world are in peril. And that's not hyperbole. That is a fact.\"\nClimate campaigners responded to Biden's comments by urging him to declare a national climate emergency and stop all fossil fuel projects, highlighting his refusal to block the Line 3 tar sands pipeline opposed by Indigenous leaders and environmentalists in Minnesota.\nThe protests came as the U.S. president held a climate meeting with leaders of major economies and confirmed a new global pledge to reduce methane pollution at least 30% by 2030. Biden's event followed his leadership summit in April, during which he pledged to cut the nation's overall planet-heating emissions in half within this decade.\nActivists on Friday \"shut down 4th Avenue in downtown Seattle, and disrupted business at the Canadian Consulate, Chase, and Bank of America,\" according to the Washington city's arm of 350.org.\nSTMP explained that \"they're targeting the world's biggest financers of climate chaos, as well as the Canadian government, who bought the troubled Trans Mountain oil pipeline in 2018.\"\nThe demonstrations in New York City, Seattle, and beyond came as a new U.N. analysis revealed that recent emissions reduction pledges governments have made in anticipation of COP 26 are nowhere near ambitious enough to meet the Paris agreement's 1.5\u00b0C target.\nAccording the new report, the world is on track for 2.7\u00b0C or warming by 2100\u2014a revelation that prompted U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to warn that a failure to meet the Paris temperature goal \"will be measured in the massive loss of lives and livelihoods.\"\n"

Larry Hogan, also noted that 95% of new Covid-19 cases in the state last month and 93% of the coronavirus-related hospitalizations occurred in unvaccinated people.\n\"Vaccines work,\" Kevin Kinnally, legislative director at the nonprofit Maryland Association of Counties, tweeted in response to the new data.\nNearly 70% of Maryland residents over the age of 18 have been vaccinated, according to a New York Times database, and the state recorded roughly 130 deaths in June.\nWith the ultra-contagious Delta variant of Covid-19 spreading rapidly in unvaccinated pockets of the U.S., Maryland Health Secretary Dennis Schrader said last week that the state is working hard to change the minds of people who have refused to get vaccinated or hesitated to make their appointments.\n\"We're not giving up on any county,\" said Schrader. \"We really believe that we've got a lot more work to do\u2014and we're not going to slow down or stop until we get as many people vaccinated as possible.\"\nThe new figures out of Maryland come days after Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\u00a0said that \"about 99.2%\" of coronavirus deaths across the U.S. in June were among unvaccinated people. The U.S. is currently averaging more than 190 deaths from Covid-19 each day.\n\"No vaccine is perfect,\" Fauci said during an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday. \"But when you talk about the avoidability of hospitalization and death... it's really sad and tragic that most all of these are avoidable and preventable.\"\n\"The common enemy is the virus,\" Fauci added, \"and we have a tool\u2014a highly effective tool\u2014against this virus.\"\nOn Tuesday, in an effort to jumpstart stalled vaccination rates across the country, the Biden White House announced a new initiative that will include \"targeted, community-by-community, door-to-door outreach to get the remaining Americans vaccinated by ensuring they have the information they need on how both safe and accessible the vaccine is.\"\n"

A pandemic is real when there are sufficient cases in multiple countries.  COVID19 qualifies as the biggest pandemic of the last 100 years - so it is very real.\nNext the mRNA vaccine double blind studies had serious disease and death as endpoints and the vaccines were shown to unequivocally reduce those endpoints.  Studies of preventing asymptomatic COVID have been done using a different method.  Those studies are done by following people from a population who has been continuous tested  and see what happens to those who get vaccinated versus those that don\u2019t.  Such studies have been done, for example at St. Jude\u2019s hospital here in the U.S. (see ~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779854)\nThe safety profile for the mRNA vaccines has been outstanding with more than 300 million doses already administered in the U.S. alone.",

                                "description": " Jake Johnson\nA national patient organization launched new ads on Friday targeting Reps. Scott Peters and Kathleen Rice for opposing a plan to let Medicare directly negotiate prescription drug prices, a centerpiece of the Democratic Party's popular agenda to lower sky-high medicine costs.\nIn the two 30-second spots\u2014titled \"Sellout\" and \"Patients Over Profit\"\u2014multiple sclerosis patient\u00a0Therese Ball slams Peters (D-Calif.) and Rice (D-N.Y.) for prioritizing the interests of the pharmaceutical industry, which has lobbied aggressively against the Medicare drug-pricing proposal.\n\"The medications I need to live are priced at over $7,000 every month. I can't afford these prices. I don't know how anybody can,\" Ball says in the ad aimed at Peters, a major recipient of pharma donations who, like Rice, hails from a safe Democratic district. During the 2020 election cycle, Peters raked in campaign cash from Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Gilead, and other pharmaceutical giants.\n\"It makes me so angry that members of Congress are choosing Big Pharma over patients,\" Ball continues. \"It's unforgivable.\"\nThe ads, launched by Patients for Affordable Drugs Now, urge Peters' and Rice's constituents to call their offices and demand that they \"stop selling us out to drug companies\" and \"put lower prices for patients before drug company profits.\"\nEarlier this week, Peters, Rice, and Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) teamed up with Republicans to block a Medicare price-negotiation plan from passing out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, potentially imperiling Democrats' efforts to include the provision in their emerging reconciliation package. As The Oregonian reported following the vote, Schrader \"inherited a fortune from his grandfather who was a top executive at pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, has accepted large donations from Big Pharma during his seven terms in Congress.\"\nUnder current federal law, Medicare is barred from negotiating prescription medicine prices directly with pharmaceutical companies, which have virtually unchecked power to set prices as they please\u2014one of the primary reasons the U.S. pays far more for the same drugs than other rich countries.\nDemocrats' proposal\u2014a version of which Peters, Rice, and Schrader voted for just two years ago\u2014would empower the secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare. The negotiated prices would then be made available to Medicare recipients as well as patients on private insurance plans.\nWhile the proposal failed to advance out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the House's chief tax-writing panel approved the provision earlier this week, offering some hope that the key drug-pricing language will ultimately end up in the final reconciliation bill. Democrats believe their plan would dramatically slash costs for patients and result in hundreds of billions of dollars in federal savings, which could then be used to fund an expansion of Medicare benefits.\nDavid Mitchell, a cancer patient and founder of Patients for Affordable Drugs Now, said in a statement Friday that \"we will not stand by while these representatives attempt to block effective Medicare negotiation legislation that would bring relief 90% of Americans are demanding.\"\n\"We look forward to the full House and Senate enacting effective Medicare negotiation legislation in the reconciliation package that will ensure patients get the innovation we need at prices we can afford,\" Mitchell added.\n"

Since then they have passed, nothing. The filibuster is still in place. And now I fear that I will be correct in my assertion made months ago, that this congress will get nothing done before years end.\nWhat we are witnessing in the culmination of Ronald Reagan\u2019s forty year plan.

These include the killing of dozens of Yemeni fishers in a 2015 attack, an Apache helicopter strike on a boat full of Somali refugees that killed at least 40 people in 2017, and a \"double-tap\" airstrike that killed 30 civilians, including first responders, in 2015.\nSaudi Arabia's war crimes in Yemen, its monarchy's support for international terrorism, and its horrific human rights record have prompted calls from across the U.S. political spectrum for a reevaluation of relations with the oil-rich and geostrategically important ally.\n"

                                "description": " Kenny Stancil\nInfuriated human rights advocates on Thursday denounced the Biden administration for resuming deportation flights to Haiti\u2014even as residents of the impoverished Caribbean nation continue to struggle in the aftermath of last month's disastrous earthquake and tropical storm, which came amid the Covid-19 pandemic and in the wake of an ongoing political-economic crisis.\n\"That ICE would continue to carry out the mass deportations of our Haitian neighbors\u2014with Haiti in the midst of its worst political, public health, and economic crises yet\u2014is cruel and callous.\"\u2014Rep. Ayanna Pressley\n\"We are in utter disbelief that the Biden administration would deport Haitians now,\" Guerline Jozef, co-founder and executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, told The Hill. \"Hours after the 7.2 magnitude earthquake, President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0released a statement saying that the United States was a 'friend' of Haiti. A 'friend' does not continuously inflict pain on another friend.\"\n\"And yet, today, just one month after this devastating earthquake and storm that resulted in the deaths of over 2,200 Haitians, injured 12,000 people, damaged or destroyed 120,000 homes, and displaced hundreds of thousands of people, the administration sent a plane full of families to Haiti under Title 42, including children under the age of three, without offering them legal protection and the opportunity to file for asylum,\" added Jozef.\nDespite the pleas of immigrant rights advocates\u2014who last month asked the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to halt deportations to Haiti and extend the eligibility date for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) benefits\u2014Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\u00a0reportedly\u00a0expelled 86 Haitians from the U.S. on Wednesday, banishing them to a country where clean water, food, shelter, and coronavirus vaccines, among other lifesaving necessities, are immensely difficult to obtain.\n\"That ICE would continue to carry out the mass deportations of our Haitian neighbors\u2014with Haiti in the midst of its worst political, public health, and economic crises yet\u2014is cruel and callous,\" Rep.\u00a0Ayanna Pressley\u00a0(D-Mass.) told The Hill.\nIn May, DHS permitted Hatians \"currently residing in the United States as of May 21, 2021 to file initial applications for TPS, so long as they meet eligibility requirements.\" Recipients are allowed to live and work in the U.S. without risk of deportation for 18 months.\nFollowing the\u00a0assassination\u00a0of former President Jovenel Mo\u00efse on July 7, DHS\u00a0expanded\u00a0Haiti's TPS designation to include Haitians living in the U.S. as of July 29, 2021.\u00a0\n\"Given the instability and suffering on the ground in Haiti, the last thing we should be doing is deporting Haitians.\"\u2014Frank Sharry, America's Voice\nHowever, a week after\u00a0Mo\u00efse was killed, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\u00a0announced\u00a0that Haitian migrants who attempted to travel to the U.S. via boat would be intercepted by the Coast Guard and either turned back or sent to a third country for resettlement.\nAlthough the TPS designation could protect up to 150,000 Haitians from deportation, potentially thousands of Haitian immigrants entered the U.S. after the July 29 deadline or are stuck in Mexican border cities.\nThose who make it to the U.S. are at risk of expulsion, with no opportunity to request asylum, under Title 42.\u00a0First invoked in March 2020 by former President Donald Trump during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, Title 42 is an obscure, 77-year-old public health law that the Trump administration used in an effort to close off the\u00a0southern U.S. border, effectively denying tens of thousands of vulnerable people the right to seek asylum.\nWhile the Biden administration has continued the harmful\u00a0policy, deporting hundreds of thousands\u00a0of individuals,\u00a0including Haitians, under Title 42\u2014as well as another \"expedited removal\" procedure\u2014a federal judge on Thursday ordered the White House\u00a0to end its use of the public health provision following a lawsuit\u00a0filed by human rights groups.\nAfter the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti, the Obama administration\u2014which deported roughly three million people\u2014stopped\u00a0expelling Haitians for more than a year. Biden has yet to implement a similar moratorium.\n\"The news of renewed Haitian deportation flights is the type of morally indefensible news we would have expected from the Trump administration, not the Biden administration,\" said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice. \"Given the instability and suffering on the ground in Haiti, the last thing we should be doing is deporting Haitians. These deportation flights should stop, full stop.\"\n"

                                "description": " Koohan Paik-Mander\nAs a longtime Hawaii resident, I have always scratched my head as to how Grover Cleveland\u2014the president of the United States\u2014had been so ineffective when it came to foreign policy. His efforts to right the wrong of the unauthorized armed invasion and imprisonment of Queen Liliuokalani in 1893 fell woefully short. Corporate and military forces influenced Congress to undermine the president and successfully orchestrate the overthrow of the sovereign nation of Hawaii.\nThe U.S. has responded by steadily and dangerously amping up military maneuvers in the South China Sea. China has followed suit, and we now find ourselves in fever-pitch Cold War 2.0.\nHow could such a consequential misstep have been allowed to let happen?\nA similar betrayal took place on September 9, 2021. That's when President Biden had called President Xi of China to work toward rapprochement, only to be undermined the very next day by forces in his own cabinet in a way that may be sending us all careening toward WWIII.\nMr. Biden's goal on the phone call was to ratchet down the brinkmanship that has been accelerating tension in the western Pacific for years. His key offering to Mr. Xi was the reassurance that the U.S. would continue to respect the One China policy.\nThe One China policy has been honored by the U.S. since 1972. It asserts that there is only one China, and that Taiwan is part of it, not a separate nation-state. The policy calls for the U.S. to \"officially\" recognize China, rather than the island of Taiwan, but at the same time, the U.S. is free to continue a robust relationship with Taiwan, which has included weapons sales.\u00a0\nFor all its ambiguity, the policy has kept peace in the Taiwan Straits for half a century. However, that has changed in recent years, as China's influence in the world has grown at a rate that threatens U.S. hegemony. The U.S. does not wish to lose its influence in the waters around Taiwan, where trillions of dollars in trade pass every year. But that is what would happen if Taiwan were to eventually unify with China. In resistance to such a fate, the U.S. has responded by steadily and dangerously amping up military maneuvers in the South China Sea. China has followed suit, and we now find ourselves in fever-pitch Cold War 2.0.\u00a0\nMock battles over control of Taiwan are a recurrent scenario staged in frequent U.S. war exercises, which decimate sea life in the Pacific. Defending Taiwan was also a featured maneuver during the \"Large Scale Exercise 2021,\" when marines and navy set up shop in Hawaii for two weeks in August. Needless to say, China finds these exercises highly provocative and even insulting.\nSo, for Mr. Biden to pick up the phone to find a way to avert global war, the world should've been able to breathe a sigh of relief.\nUnfortunately, that wasn't in the cards. Mr. Biden's own administration officials seem to have been very alarmed by their boss's dovish behavior; so much so that they quickly worked to reverse his conciliatory tone. Anonymous sources leaked to the Financial Times that Washington was seriously\u00a0 considering changing the name of Taiwan's mission in the U.S. capitol from \"Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office\" to \"Taiwan Representative Office.\" Sure to raise the ire of Beijing, the new nomenclature bestows near-embassy status, a ranking reserved only for full-fledged nation states.\u00a0\u00a0\nAppearing the very next day, the Financial Times report was timed perfectly to overshadow Mr. Biden's conciliatory foray with Mr. Xi just the day before. The report also revealed that the inflammatory name-change idea was backed by White House Asia Advisor Kurt Campbell, the National Security Council, and officials from the State Department Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.\nAccording to a rush report in the Financial Times that came out the very same day as the U.S.-Taiwan meeting, the name-change idea is backed by White House Asia Advisor Kurt Campbell, the National Security Council, and officials from the State Department Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.\nWhat's in a name? A lot. One of China's newspapers of record, the Global Times, angrily responded, \"if the U.S. and the island of Taiwan do make the name change, it will mean Washington's basic abandonment of its 'one-China policy.'\"\nThe following day, another excoriating editorial in the Global Times implied that the duplicitousness of the U.S. as the reason that China must \"firmly seize the strategic initiative of the regional situation.\" The report resolutely continued, \"Sending PLA fighter jets over the island of Taiwan is a step we must take.\"\nAt the very least, the impact of fighter jets over Taiwan will send the commercial air industry reeling, as hundreds of routes would have to be adjusted to circumvent trouble. If Taiwan fires back, strategic escalation would be rapid and risky.\nRhetoric from China is not the colorful hyperbole that it is from North Korea. Language out of China is consistently measured. They don't tend to bluff. We should take this very seriously. The Global Times editorial assures, \"Let us be fully prepared that there will be a showdown in the Taiwan Straits.\"\nSo, there you have it. In only 24 hours' time, the Financial Times story accomplished Mr. Campbell's task: He and other high ranking officials succeeded in undermining Mr. Biden's credibility and infuriating China. Most tragically, they sabotaged Mr. Biden's desire to avert the perils of strategic war. Regional stability is spiraling downward once again.\nShame on them.\nJust as President Cleveland's authority had been ignored in Washington to instead favor corporate and military interests, so it goes today. There's big money in war with China. So much, that powerful people seem eager to risk the likelihood of Mutually Assured Destruction.\n Koohan Paik-Mander\nKoohan Paik-Mander, who grew up in postwar Korea and on the U.S. colony of Guam,\u00a0is a Hawaii-based journalist and media educator.

                                "description": " Jake Johnson\nThe decision by Congress and the Biden administration to let pandemic-related unemployment programs expire earlier this month will slash annual incomes across the U.S. by $144.3 billion and significantly reduce consumer spending, the Economic Policy Institute estimates in an analysis released Friday.\n\"The resulting income and consumer spending losses of the most recent unemployment benefit cuts will be devastating.\"\nDrawing on recent research (pdf) examining the 26 states that prematurely ended the emergency unemployment insurance (UI) programs, EPI argues that the \"best available evidence\" indicates the benefit cut-offs thus far have resulted in \"all pain and no gain.\"\n\"By failing to extend unemployment benefits, Congress and the White House will harm working people struggling in the pandemic,\" said Ben Zipperer, an EPI economist and co-author of the new report. \"Annualized incomes will fall by $144 billion and consumer spending will drop by $79 billion.\"\n\"Congress should immediately restore the pandemic unemployment benefits,\" Zipperer added.\nApproved by Congress last year to help jobless workers weather the pandemic-induced economic crisis, the emergency UI programs extended aid to typically ineligible gig workers and to those who had exhausted their eligibility for state-level benefits. Another program, known as Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), boosted unemployment benefits by $300 per week.\nDespite pleas from worker advocates, the Biden White House and Congress\u2014under the full control of the Democratic Party\u2014allowed the programs to expire nationwide on Labor Day, stripping benefits from more than nine million people. Administration officials made clear last month that President Joe Biden felt it was \"appropriate\" for the $300-per-week federal boost to end as scheduled, even as the Delta variant wreaked havoc on the still-ailing U.S. economy.\nIn its new analysis, EPI points out that \"the extended benefits were a significant reason why the number of people in poverty actually fell in 2020 despite record-level job losses.\"\nRepublican leaders that terminated the emergency UI benefits ahead of their nationwide expiration on September 6 claimed the programs were dissuading people from returning to the workforce. But subsequent research demonstrated that the premature cut-offs did virtually nothing to boost hiring.\n\"Removing those income supports will increase poverty and will disproportionately harm people of color,\" EPI warned Friday, noting that the impacts will be felt in every state.\n\"Overall, the resulting income and consumer spending losses of the most recent unemployment benefit cuts will be devastating to families struggling during the Covid-19 pandemic,\" EPI said. \"Congress should immediately restore the pandemic unemployment benefits and begin work on long-run reform of the UI system.\"\nEPI's report comes days after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and several other House Democrats announced plans to introduce legislation that would extend the lapsed UI programs through February 1, 2022, with benefits retroactive to September 6.\n\"Expanded unemployment benefits have been a critical lifeline for millions of families struggling to make ends meet throughout this public health and economic crisis,\" said Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), an original co-sponsor of the bill. \"This pandemic is far from over and we must extend these critical benefits to help keep our most vulnerable families fed, safe, and housed.\"\nIn a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez and a dozen other Democratic lawmakers also demanded the inclusion of systemic UI reforms in the party's emerging budget reconciliation package.\n\"We are proud of the many provisions in the Build Back Better Act designed to promote economic opportunity, security, and fairness for all. For this reason, we believe that unemployment insurance reform is an essential component to this objective and must not be left out,\" the letter reads. \"A strong and responsive UI system not only helps our entire economy more quickly and equitably recover from future recessions, it is also an essential tool to help dislocated workers stay connected to the workforce and to provide for their families as they seek new employment.\"\n"

                                "description": " Thom Hartmann\nJoint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley stepped outside the realm of his constitutional power to prevent Donald Trump from starting nuclear war with China or Iran. \u00a0It was definitely unconstitutional and probably illegal. \u00a0But he's not the true villain in this story; the true villain is almost never mentioned in the press.\nTrump's advisors aren't the villains, either, although Trump was just the latest Republican president advised by Paul Manafort and Roger Stone, whose partner in the years after they advised Nixon, Lee Atwater, had passed away from brain cancer after making a public apology for all the damage he did to our nation in the service of Nixon's party and, later, George HW Bush (Willie Horton, et al).\nAmerican media needs to put the blame for that squarely where it belongs: fifty Republicans in the US Senate who chose their own self-interest over our county when Trump's impeached fate was in their hands.\nAnd Nixon, too, presented such a threat to world peace and democracy in America that his own Defense Secretary, James Schlesinger, took actions remarkably similar to Milley's, as was revealed by the Washington Post on August 22, 1974. Schlesinger and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs George S. Brown (who'd just taken that post on July 1, 1974), the Post wrote, \"kept a close watch to make certain that no orders were given to military units outside the normal chain of command.\"\nSpecifically, Schlesinger and Brown were worried that Nixon would start a nuclear war to stay in power as he became increasingly under siege in the Watergate scandal. Congress relieved them of that burden when Barry Goldwater walked over to the White House and informed Nixon that both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate were going to vote to impeach and remove him from office if he didn't resign immediately.\nWhich highlights the true villains in the General Mark Milley story who are almost always overlooked in the press: 50 Republicans in the US Senate, led by Mitch McConnell, who twice refused to remove Trump from office after the House had impeached him.\nIt's not like these senators didn't know that Trump was an unstable narcissist who had both loyalties and financial ties to autocrats in Russia, Turkey and multiple other foreign countries. They not only knew but were informed in great detail during the first opportunity they were given to remove Trump from office in December of 2019.\u00a0\nThe impeachment managers laid out in excruciating detail the evidence that Trump had repeated for the 2020 election what he and his children had tried to do with Russia in 2016: solicit foreign interference in a US election, this time by trying to bribe the president of Ukraine with the promise of American weapons.\u00a0 At any other time in American history that would have been prosecuted as outright treason.\nFor example, in the election of 1800, then-Vice President Thomas Jefferson benefited from what we'd today call a tabloid journalist, James Callender, publishing stories about the XYZ Affair that explicitly suggested his opponent, then-President John Adams, had provoked the cold naval war with France that came out of the scandal just to help his reelection chances. The charges of treason hurt Adams badly in that election, helping hand it to Jefferson.\nWhile Adams almost certainly hadn't committed treason to stay in office, Trump almost certainly did, or something close to it.\u00a0 But the Republicans in the Senate were apparently unconcerned.\nThey knew by then that Trump and his family had both openly and secretly solicited and received Russian help in the 2016 election, that he'd trashed American intelligence agencies while elevating Russia's in a public meeting with President Putin in Helsinki way back in July of 2018, and that he'd tried to strong-arm the president of Ukraine to manufacture dirt on Joe Biden.\nCompared to Richard Nixon paying to bug the DNC headquarters in the Watergate complex and then lie about it afterwards, Trump's behaviors were monstrous. But Republicans gave him a pass on his criminal behavior.\u00a0Twice.\nIf even a bit over a dozen of them had had the courage of the senate Republicans in 1974, Milley never would have been in a position to worry that an American president might start a nuclear war just to hang onto power and thus avoid prosecution.\nBut Senate Republicans are proudly lacking in courage, patriotism or any sense of loyalty to our nation or its ideals; their only loyalties are to their own power and the billions their donors use to seduce and control them.\u00a0\nMilley (and then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper) shouldn't have had to take actions that may well have saved the republic if Trump had played out what he was considering.\u00a0\nAnd the American media needs to put the blame for that squarely where it belongs: fifty Republicans in the US Senate who chose their own self-interest over our county when Trump's impeached fate was in their hands.\nThis article, which appears here with permission, was first published on The Hartmann Report.\n Thom Hartmann\n"

At the time\u202fof the Occupy movement in 2011,\u202funemployment was still rising, the poverty rate hovered at 15 percent and people were losing their homes.\u202fThe typical family\u202flost 40 percent of its wealth, with much deeper pain for poorer households and communities of color. All\u202fwhile Wall Street came roaring back.\u00a0\u00a0\nOccupy protesters look prescient now. During the early days of the pandemic and recession, unemployment spiked faster than in any year since 1939. Yet billionaires added $1.8 trillion to their wealth from March 2020 to August 2021.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThis systemic unfairness was at the heart of the Occupy protests in the fall of 2011. The financial industry helped\u202fwreck\u202fthe economy, and our\u202fgovernment worked to make them whole with no real strings attached. They didn't have to\u202fpay their workers\u202f better. They didn't have to curb executive compensation. We, collectively, didn't demand better corporate citizenship.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 2017, elected officials made the same mistake. The Republican Congress gave enormous corporate tax cuts and promised\u2014it turned out falsely\u2014that companies would use their tax breaks to invest in America. Instead, these companies largely rewarded their shareholders and executives. Stock buybacks reached record levels in 2018 and 2019, and corporate tax payments shrunk. My colleagues released a report this year that found 39 profitable Fortune 500 corporations paid zero in taxes on average from 2018 to 2020 despite earning $122 billion over that period. Fifty-five profitable corporations avoided federal income tax in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 2021, many people better understand the crucial role of government and what it means when it works and when it doesn't. Government action made poverty go down in 2020 (when measured after benefits) in the face of an unemployment spike at Depression levels. Government funding delivered a vaccine at \"warp speed\" and government action ensured that millions of adults who wanted the vaccine could get it within months after it became available.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe need an economy that works for all of us. And we need a government that can tackle our problems. This starts with tax policy that raises resources from the millionaires and billionaires who continue to thrive in an increasingly unequal America.\u00a0\u00a0\nProgressive taxation enables a public sector that can deliver us from the economic, health and climate emergencies that scream from the headlines every day in 2021. President Biden has put forth a tax plan that begins to do that. Congress must deliver.\n Amy Hanauer\nAmy Hanauer joined ITEP in 2020, bringing nearly 30 years of experience working to create economic policy that advances social justice. As executive director of both ITEP and Citizens for Tax Justice, Amy provides vision and leadership to promote fair and equitable state and national tax policy.\n"

                                "description": " Kenny Stancil\nAs people reflect on the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, progressives drew attention to another horrifying event less well-known in the U.S. but referred to elsewhere as \"the other 9/11\": the bombing of Chile's presidential palace on September 11, 1973 by the nation's armed forces during a right-wing coup supported by Washington and other capitalist regimes.\nSalvador Allende, Chile's democratically elected socialist president, died during the assault on La Moneda in Santiago, which brought to power Gen. Augusto Pinochet, whose brutal military junta imposed neoliberalism through deadly force,\u00a0torture, and the \"disappearance\" of thousands of leftists. Despite its awareness\u00a0of Pinochet's human rights abuses, including his execution of political opponents, the U.S. continued to support\u00a0the pro-market dictator during his bloody, 17-year-long reign.\n\"On this day in 1973, Salvador Allende's democratically elected socialist government was\u00a0overthrown in a military coup led by the U.S.-backed fascist Augusto Pinochet,\"\u00a0Progressive International, a global coalition of social justice groups fighting for a more egalitarian and sustainable world, said Saturday on social media.\nJournalist Alan Macleod pointed out that \"Chile would be ruled by a gruesome fascist dictatorship for decades, the scars of which are still very fresh.\"\n\"But people in the West,\" MacLeod argued, \"are largely insulated from the realities of empire thanks to a pliant media, which never shows you the effect of the bombs, sanctions, coups, etc.\"\nProgressive International noted that \"Allende was elected Chile's first socialist president in 1970 as the candidate of Popular Unity, a socialist-communist coalition. He quickly went to work reorganizing the society he inherited, characterized by poverty and confined by the greed of international corporations.\"\nThe organization highlighted some of what the Popular Unity government accomplished during its three years in power:\nThe Allende government nationalized Chile's foreign-owned copper industry, which was responsible for 75% of exports. Rather than compensate the former owners, Allende sought payment for the unfairly extracted resource. He did not stop with copper.\nIn its first year, the government nationalized 91 industries, redistributed 5.5 [million] acres of land, granted wage rises to the working class, and built quality homes for the poor.\nAllende hoped to build a sovereign, developed, democratic, and humane nation\u2014and one whose foreign policy was built on principles of friendship.\nThe democratic socialist alternative pursued in Chile, however, \"was intolerable to the forces of empire,\" Progressive International added. \"Fearing that Allende would set a good example for other nations to follow, U.S. President Richard Nixon ordered the Central Intelligence Agency to 'make the economy scream,'\" in an effort to bring down the Popular Unity government.\nOther rich and powerful countries also worked to sabotage the Allende administration. As\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0reported Friday, declassified government documents verify how the Australian Secret Intelligence Service opened a base in Santiago in 1971 and conducted covert operations alongside the U.S. CIA for 18 months, contributing to the destabilization of Chile's economy that preceded Pinochet's violent overthrow of Popular Unity.\nAs his offices were being bombarded on September 11, Allende gave his last speech. MacLeod on Saturday shared a clip from John Pilger's 2007 documentary,\u00a0The War on Democracy, showcasing the former Chilean president's \"final words, broadcast to the nation.\"\n\"At this definitive moment, the last moment when I can address you, I wish you to take advantage of the lesson: foreign capital, imperialism, together with the reaction, created the climate in which the armed forces broke their tradition... victims of the same social sector who today are hoping, with foreign assistance, to reconquer the power to continue defending their profits and their privileges,\" said\u00a0Allende.\n\"Workers of my country, I have faith in Chile and its destiny,\" Allende continued. \"Other men will overcome this dark and bitter moment when treason seeks to prevail. Go forward knowing that, sooner rather than later, the great avenues will open again and free men will walk through them to construct a better society.\"\n\"Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers!\" he added. \"These are my last words, and I am certain that my sacrifice will not be in vain.\"\nIf recent events in Chile are any indication, it would appear that Allende's sacrifice was not made in vain.\nLast October, as Common Dreams reported, Chileans voted in a 4-to-1 landslide to rewrite the country's right-wing constitution, which was implemented under anti-democratic conditions in 1980 with long-lasting negative repurcussions.\nWhile there have been attempts to curb market fundamentalism in Chile since the post-dictatorship period began in 1990, the neoliberal constitution crafted during the Pinochet era has continued\u00a0to exacerbate inequalities and put up barriers to egalitarian reform long after the murderous dictator's demise.\nProgressives worldwide rejoiced as the nation once deemed the \"laboratory\" of neoliberalism\u2014where University of Chicago-trained economists experimented with widespread privatization on an unwilling population\u2014had, through a massive popular rebellion against years of austerity, created an opportunity to \"bury Pinochet's legacy... and rebuild the country on a truly democratic basis,\"\u00a0as political theorist Melany Cruz put it\u00a0at the time.\nFollowing last year's historic referendum\u2014the product of a decades-long\u00a0revolt\u00a0against the denial of\u00a0guaranteed access to public goods such as water, education, healthcare, pensions, and other necessities\u2014Chileans earlier this year took another major step toward defeating Pinochetismo once and for all.\nAs\u00a0Common Dreams reported,\u00a0Chilean voters in May elected a progressive slate of delegates to the constituent assembly tasked with rewriting Pinochet's constitution.\nA large majority of the 155\u00a0delegates responsible for reshaping the nation's political framework over the next several months are expected to bring progressive perspectives rather than pro-corporate orthodoxy to the table, giving Chileans\u2014who will be asked next year in another national referendum whether they accept the new constitution\u2014a real shot to turn neoliberalism's birthplace into its graveyard.\n"

In our market economy we need to start paying inventors or else pray to God for their charity upon us.  We need inventors, engineers, mechanics, more inventors and bunches of young apprentices with decent SAT Math scores.  We need labs.

It is one part of a larger crisis.\n\n\nTo my mind, AGW carries this special significance: It is the result of releasing concentrated sunlight from hundreds of millions of years ago. When carbon is exhumed from geologic to surface reservoirs, the damage is as durable as that term of concentrated sunlight: hundreds of millions of years, imho.\nThat\u2019s far more durable damage to the global ecosystem from extraction, than from anything else humankind does. Even the radioactive half-life of kerflooery nuke plants will not outlast the heating from extraction. Step one: stop fossil extraction immediately.",

                                "description": " Andrea Germanos\nA group of over 400 economists on Wednesday sent a letter to congressional leaders calling for the expanded child tax credit to be made permanent, citing \"potential tremendous immediate and long-term benefits for children and their families.\"\nThe America Recovery Plan, prompted by the pandemic, expanded the child tax credit (CTC), first enacted over two decades ago. In addition to boosting the amount of the credit to up to $3,600 for parents of younger children, it advanced half of the credit ahead of tax-filing time.\nThe third round of payments from the CTC hit bank accounts this week, with parents of eligible children under age 6 receiving $300 per child, and those of kids aged 6 to 17 receiving $250 per child. The payments have already been shown to have a positive impact by helping families with household expenses, including being able to put enough food on the table.\nThat economic aid has been especially crucial because \"childhood poverty is a staggering problem in the United States, affecting approximately one in seven children, and one in five children of color, even before the Covid-19 pandemic began,\" the economists wrote in their letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\nAs it stands now, eligible families\u2014a couple making $150,000 or a single head of household making $112,500\u2014are on track to receive just three more rounds of checks this year. But the letter's signatories, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and inequality expert Emmanuel Saez, pointed to four broad areas to argue for making the CTC permanent, including that it would \"dramatically reduce childhood poverty in the United States.\"\nSuch an expansion, the economists wrote, would also bring about \"a long-term fiscal payoff,\" since \"reducing child poverty has a positive effect on earnings in adulthood.\" And because families' health would improve, government medical expenditures for those receiving the aid would drop.\nIn fact, the letter added, \"once the full effects of the CTC expansion are accounted for, the net cost to taxpayers of the expansion has been estimated to be as little as approximately 16 cents for every $1 of new benefits.\"\nThe economists also rejected the argument that making the CTC permanent would remove incentives to work, noting in part that because \"the expanded CTC amount would not phase out until high levels of earnings... most families would not see their CTC amount decline if their income rises.\"\nThere's also evidence the payments are simply being used to meet basic needs, the letter said. \"With the first monthly payments of the temporary CTC expansion in the United States,\" the letter noted, \"families increased spending on food, clothes, utilities, [and] school supplies, and reduced debt, and food insecurity declined dramatically.\"\nHouse Democrats, meanwhile, have proposed continuing the CTC aid through 2025. The outcome of that push, however, remains uncertain, as it would be part of the reconciliation bill, which needs support from all Democrats to pass.\u00a0\n"

                                "description": " Common Dreams staff\nThe People's Vaccine Alliance on Wednesday called out BioNTech, Moderna, and Pfizer for \"reaping astronomical and unconscionable profits due to their monopolies of mRNA Covid vaccines,\" developed with the help of public funding, while the two U.S. firms paid little in taxes.\n\"These pharmaceutical companies prioritize their own profits by enforcing their monopolies and selling to the highest bidder.\"\u2014Robbie Silverman, Oxfam America\nThe alliance is a coalition of over 75 groups, including Oxfam, campaigning for equitable vaccination. While 42.4% of the global population has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, less than 2% of people in low-income countries have had at least one shot, according to Our World in Data.\n\"Big Pharma\u2019s business model\u2014receive billions in public investments, charge exorbitant prices for lifesaving medicines, pay little tax\u2014is gold dust for wealthy investors and corporate executives but devastating for global public health,\" said Robbie Silverman, Oxfam America's private sector engagement manager, in a statement.\n\"Instead of partnering with governments and other qualified manufacturers to make sure that we have enough vaccine doses for everyone, these pharmaceutical companies prioritize their own profits by enforcing their monopolies and selling to the highest bidder,\" he added. \"Enough is enough\u2014we must start putting people before profits.\"\nAn alliance analysis based on work by mRNA scientists at Imperial College London found that Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have sold over 90% of their vaccines to wealthy countries while charging up to 24 times the potential cost of production.\nOn top of overcharging for vaccines that were developed with $8.3 billion in public money and potentially could be made for as little as $1.20 per dose, the U.S. companies \"have not paid their fair share of taxes\" while recording significant profits, the coalition charges.\nAccording to the alliance:\nIn the first half of 2021, Moderna paid a 7% U.S. tax rate and Pfizer paid a 15% tax rate, well below the U.S. statutory rate of 21%. The low tax rates paid by these U.S. corporations point to a broken and dysfunctional tax system that allows corporations earning billions of dollars to pay a significantly lower tax rate than working families in the U.S. BioNTech, a German startup that produced the recipe for the Pfizer vaccine, paid a significantly higher tax rate of 31%... in Germany while reaping a 77% profit margin.\nPfizer, which developed its mRNA vaccine with BioNTech, has sold over $11 billion in Covid-19 vaccines this year\u2014a figure expected to hit $33.5 billion by the end of 2021. The alliance noted that though the company says its vaccine profit margins are below 30%, it is not possible to independently verify that due to what information Pfizer does and doesn't make public.\nModerna, meanwhile, saw a 69% profit margin on its vaccine, the coalition found. The company, which expects to sell $20 billion in vaccines this year, has so far brought in over $6 billion in revenue, $4.3 billion of which is profit.\nAs pharmaceutical companies have made billions on Covid-19 vaccines, the industry has also lobbied against waiving patent protections, despite global pleas to dramatically increase production in order to save lives and prevent the emergence of more dangerous variants.\nSilverman warned that \"vaccine hoarding by rich countries and profiteering by rich pharma companies when millions across the world are being denied protection are not only morally wrong, but also shortsighted and dangerous.\"\n\"As the Delta variant clearly demonstrates, if Covid is left unchecked in other parts of the world, a mutation can lead to widespread transmission of the virus and severe illness or death amongst those who are not vaccinated,\" he said. \"Future variants could send us back to square one.\"\n\"These corporations have maximized their revenues and profits by preventing others from producing the vaccines and by minimizing the taxes they pay,\" Silverman added. \"We need a People's Vaccine, which means sharing the vaccine recipe, leveraging the world's full manufacturing capacity, and producing enough doses for everyone. No one will be safe until everyone is safe.\"\nHis warning comes as some wealthy countries with higher vaccination rates are administering or considering booster shots, which experts say could make Covid-19 vaccines even less accessible to residents of poorer countries.\n\"Rich countries buying up more doses to give third shots to their residents while most countries struggle to provide first doses to their doctors and nurses illustrates the fundamental inequality that has prevailed in our response to Covid thus far,\" said Maaza Seyoum of the African Alliance and the People's Vaccine Alliance in Africa.\n\"This unequal status quo,\" Seyoum added, \"is resulting in needless deaths across the globe and producing new variants that threaten public health everywhere\u2014all to fatten the wallets for Big Pharma executives and corporate investors.\"\n"

                                "description": " Jake Johnson\nUp to half of the estimated $14 trillion that the Pentagon has spent in the two decades since the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan has gone to private military contractors, with corporate behemoths such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, and General Dynamics hoovering up much of the money.\n\"Reducing the profits of war ultimately depends on reducing the resort to war in the first place.\"\u2014William Hartung, Center for International Policy\nThat's according to a new paper (pdf) authored by William Hartung\u2014director of the Arms and Security Program at the Center for International Policy\u2014and released Monday by Brown University's Costs of War Project.\nPublished just days after the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks and two weeks after the last U.S. military plane departed Afghanistan, the paper documents the extent to which the massive post-9/11 surge in Pentagon spending benefited weapon makers, logistics firms, private security contractors, and other corporate interests.\n\"The magnitude of Pentagon spending in the wake of the 9/11 attacks was remarkable,\" Hartung observes. \"The increase in U.S. military spending between Fiscal Year 2002 and Fiscal Year 2003 was more than the entire military budget of any other country, including major powers like China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.\"\nAccording to Hartung's analysis, from \"one-third to one-half\" of the Pentagon's $14 trillion in spending since the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan on October 2001 went to defense contractors, which spend heavily on government lobbying.\n\"A large portion of these contracts\u2014one-quarter to one-third of all Pentagon contracts in recent years\u2014have gone to just five major corporations: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman,\" Hartung writes. \"The $75 billion in Pentagon contracts received by Lockheed Martin in fiscal year 2020 is well over one and one-half times the entire budget for the State Department and Agency for International Development for that year, which totaled $44 billion.\"\nBut those five corporate giants are far from the only companies that profited from the increase in U.S. Defense Department outlays following the Afghanistan invasion, which ultimately killed more than 46,000 Afghan civilians. Hartung notes that numerous other firms\u2014including Erik Prince's since-rebranded Blackwater, the Dick Cheney-tied company Halliburton, and DynCorp\u2014benefited handsomely from the Pentagon spending boom.\n\"Halliburton's Pentagon contracts grew more than tenfold from FY2002 to FY2006 on the strength of its contracts to rebuild Iraq's oil infrastructure and provide logistical support for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" the new paper reads. \"By 2009, over half of DynCorp's revenues were coming from the Iraq and Afghan wars.\"\nHartung argues that the Pentagon's growing reliance on private contractors to carry out U.S. foreign policy in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks \"raises multiple questions of accountability, transparency, and effectiveness.\"\n\"This is problematic because privatizing key functions can reduce the U.S. military's control of activities that occur in war zones while increasing risks of waste, fraud, and abuse,\" he writes. \"Additionally, that the waging of war is a source of profits can contradict the goal of having the U.S. lead with diplomacy in seeking to resolve conflicts.\"\nIn order to rein in war profiteering and increase government \"accountability over private firms involved in conducting or preparing for war,\" Hartung recommends several broad policy changes, including:\n\"Reducing the profits of war ultimately depends on reducing the resort to war in the first place,\" Hartung writes. \"Likewise, making war less profitable decreases the incentive to go to war. Given the immense financial and human costs of America's post-9/11 wars\u2014and the negative security consequences generated by many of these conflicts\u2014adopting a new, less militarized foreign policy should be a central goal of the public and policymakers alike.\"\n"

Naturally the common people don\u2019t want war: neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But after all it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or fascist dictorship, or a parliament or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peace makers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.
