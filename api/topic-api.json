It was in the Seattle Times, a story about an Afghan immigrant, now U.S. citizen, whose Afghan wife (not U.S. citizen, w/Green Card) went back to Afghanistan to visit her parents with their American citizen children. Her return flight was scheduled for the middle of Sept. (Have to say I don\u2019t how this was the case since Biden reportedly announced at the beginning of the year we were going to be out by the end of August \u2026 but anyway,) they wanted something like 10,000 dollars to change the flight. I gather they paid it (or used credit cards?), but then, because of the situation, she wasn\u2019t able to get to the airport in time (or something) \u2013 and they wanted something similar in amount again for another seat.  Or some such horror story. That there was radical inflation of the airline tickets. Don\u2019t know if that part has since changed \u2026  sounds like it has \u2026 and \u2026 unfortunately, haven\u2019t seen news of whether this mother and her U.S. children have even gotten out yet.\nBut yes, Erik Prince is a \u201cmonstrous human.\u201d Think of the gasoline, too, for these flights only carrying a few select and wealthy whatevers (probably war criminals if they\u2019re riding with Erik).",

I saw an article yesterday in Telesur English that sounded like they actually had people on the ground out there, and as they had \u201creal\u201d information (or what sounded like real information) about getting to the airport. Short version: looking bad and soon to get much worse. But before this article, it\u2019s hard to know what is \u201creally\u201d going on outside the airport. But Psaki did make a public statement that, if people know Americans (and probably Afghans too - I forget her wording) in Afghanistan (i.e. stuck somewhere) and have their contact information, they can contact her office and they will contact them and help them leave. It\u2019s on a video, though her words aren\u2019t being shared far and wide bc they\u2019re so anxious to make the Biden administration look as bad as possible for leaving people behind, that they\u2019re actually helping to make that happen.",
